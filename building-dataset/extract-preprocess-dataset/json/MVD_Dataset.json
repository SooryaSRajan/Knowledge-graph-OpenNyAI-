CRIMINAL MISC. PETITION NO.49/2008\nSATISH KUMAR &amp; ANOTHER. V. STATE OF RAJASTHAN &amp; OTHERS.\n\nDATE OF ORDER                       :::                         25-09-2008\n\n                HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE C. M. TOTLA\n\n\nMr. P.K.Sharma, for Petitioner (s).\nMr. S. N. Tiwari, PP, for the State.\nMr.Hemant Jain, for Respondents.\n\n\n       Learned counsel for the petitioner              argued that no trunk or\nanything is manufactured in the said premises - petitioner is a business\nman, doing business, complying with all law and regulations under a valid\nlicense and business is his right as well as means of livelihood. Argued\nthat business is that of sale of containers like trunk made of metallic\nsheets and only work, if carried out, are of removing denting etc. of\nsuch metallic sheet    containers         and that   also by a wooden hammer.\nArgued that even as per orders of court below, no manufacturing work\ndone at other premises and manufacturing establishment is else where.\nStated that due to ill-will, complainant has initiated these proceedings.\n       Learned counsel for the respondents argued that findings of the\nlearned Magistrate are based on evidence - admittedly at best business is\nthat of   selling of metallic containers - even if repaired at large scale\nwhich creates nuisance.\n       Considered. As per order impugned, petitioners are restrained from\nrepairing and manufacturing of trunk either in shop or at outer portion.\nClearly only manufacture        and repair is prohibited. Specifically it is\nmentioned that business       can be carried. The order, as above, is very\nclear and reasoned one - no interference             by invoking the provisions of\nSection 482, <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_1\">Cr.P.C</a>., is called for.\n       The petition is dismissed.\n\n\n                                              (C.

Chandurkar, C.J.   \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_2\"> 1. These appeals are admitted.  \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_3\"> 2. These appeals are against the interim orders vacating the injunction earlier issued with a further observation by the learned Judge that in the event of the petitioners-appellants apprehending that they are likely to be arrested, it is open to them to move the appropriate authorities to show that they are not liable to be arrested.  \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_4\"> 3. The relief sought in the two writ petitions was that respondents 1 to 3 should be restrained by a writ of mandamus from causing the arrest and detention of the petitioners-appellants in a civil person for default in payment of sales tax. The apprehension appears to be that the authorities are taking action to arrest the two petitioners-appellants without following the prescribed procedure.  \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_5\"> 4. The writ petitions themselves can be disposed of in view of the fair attitude taken by the Additional Government Pleader (Taxes). He is not in a position to dispute that before an order of arrest is made, the provisions under <a href=\"/doc/201374/\" id=\"a_1\">section 48</a> of the Revenue Recovery Act will have to be followed. <a href=\"/doc/201374/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 48</a> prescribes certain pre-conditions before an order of arrest and imprisonment of the defaulter can be made. The pre-condition is that the arrears due from the defaulter cannot be liquidated by the sale of the property of the defaulter, or of his surety and further that the Collector shall have reason to believe that the defaulter or his surety is wilfully withholding payment of the arrears, or has been guilty of fraudulent conduct in order to evade payment. Unless these ingredients are established, the drastic power of arrest under <a href=\"/doc/201374/\" id=\"a_3\">section 48</a> cannot be exercised. It is implicit in the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/201374/\" id=\"a_4\">section 48</a> that the defaulter must have an opportunity to show that he is not willfully withholding payment of the arrears or that he is not guilty of fraudulent conduct in order to evade payment. In order to ascertain the truth or otherwise of these pleas which the defaulter is entitled to take, it is necessary for the Collector to make necessary enquiries after issuing notice to the defaulter. Unless the procedure which is implicit in the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/201374/\" id=\"a_5\">section 48</a> of the Revenue Recovery Act is followed, the jurisdiction to make an order of arrest and imprisonment of the defaulter cannot be exercised. Accordingly, the order impugned in both these appeals is set aside.  \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_6\"> 5. The writ petitions themselves have been take up for hearing with the consent of the parties. There will be an injunction against the respondents restraining them from making any order of arrest and detention of the petitioners-appellants in civil prison except in accordance with the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/201374/\" id=\"a_6\">section 48</a> of the Revenue Recovery Act and in the light of the observations made earlier in the judgment.  \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_7\"> 6. The appeals are thus allowed. The writ petitions are also allowed. However, there will be no order as to costs.  \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_8\"> 7. Writ appeals and writ petitions allowed.  \n</p>\n \n\n",

Ext.P2 contains the draft proposal for transfer in the\n\nHealth Services Department and it proposes the transfer of the\n\npetitioner from Pathanamthitta to Allapuzha.         It was objected to by\n\nthe petitioner.      As per Ext.P3 order he has been transferred to\n\nThrissur. This is challenged by the petitioner inter alia on the ground\n\nthat his transfer to Thrissur is only to accommodate the 4th respondent\n\nwho is an office bearer of the NGO union and who was only recently\n\npromoted as Senior Superintendent.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_2\">      2.   A counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of the first\n\nrespondent. The 4th respondent has also filed a counter affidavit. The\n\npetitioner has filed a reply affidavit. Learned counsel for the petitioner\n\nalleges that there is violation of the norms in the matter of petitioner's\n\ntransfer to Thrissur.      The transfer is for accommodating the 4th\n\nrespondent, it is contended, and therefore it is vitiated by malafides.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_3\">      Mere violation of the guidelines relating to transfer which are\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">WPC.18821 /2008                  2</span>\n\nnot statutory in character will not result in an enforceable right as\n\nsuch. I am not able to find anything material to accept the case of the\n\npetitioner in this regard, but I do not finally express any opinion in\n\nthis regard. In my view, it is open to the petitioner    to move the\n\nGovernment either seeking a variation of the transfer or a posting\n\nnearer to his native district of Kollam.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">      In the result, the writ petition is disposed of permitting the\n\npetitioner to move the Government against Ext.P3. If it is done within\n\nthree weeks from today, the third respondent shall consider and pass\n\norders in that regard, within a period of four weeks from the date of\n\nreceipt of a copy of this judgment. Since the petitioner has not been\n\nrelieved from Pathanamthitta on account of the order of status quo\n\npassed on 23.6.2008, he shall be retained in Pathanamthitta till the\n\nGovernment takes a decision in the manner aforementioned.          The\n\nGovernment shall hear the petitioner and the 4th respondent before\n\ntaking a decision in that regard.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_5\">\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">                                         V.

On 03/01/2001, at different points of time, the excise\n\n\nofficials   went   to   shops   14   and   15   of   which   the   petitioner   is   the\n\n\nlicensee and drew samples of toddy, which was kept for sale.  Samples\n\n\nof   toddy   collected   were   sent   to   the   chemical   examiner   and   the\n\n\nchemical   examiner   submitted   reports,   which   showed   that   the   toddy\n\n\nsamples contained 8.69% and   9.79% of ethyl alcohol.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_2\">       2.     Crime   was   registered  and  final   report   was   filed  on   these\n\n\nprecise   allegations.     The   learned   counsel   for   the   petitioner   submits\n\n\nthat   even   if   the   entire   allegations   were   accepted,   no   offence   under\n\n\nSection 57(a) of the Kerala Abkari Act will be revealed in as much as\n\n\npresence of ethyl alcohol in toddy is perfectly justified and there is no\n\n\nupper limit of the ethyl  alcohol prescribed under any  of the relevant\n\n\nrules at the relevant point of time.  Rule 9 of the Kerala Abkari Shops\n\n\nDisposal   Rules   2002   was   not  in  force  at   the  relevant  time  and  there\n\n\nwas no specific embargo against the upper limit of ethyl alcohol which\n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">Crl.M.C.No.1202/04 &amp; 1203/04                 2</span>\n\n\n\n\n\ncould be found to be present in the toddy offered for sale.  In as much\n\n\nas   ethyl   alcohol   cannot   be   said   to   be   a   foreign   substance   in   toddy,\n\n\nSection   57(a)   cannot   have   any   application,   it   is   contended.     The\n\n\nlearned   counsel   for   the   petitioner     points   out   that   paragraph   6(a)\n\n\nChapter   5   volume   2   of   the   Kerala   Excise   Manual   suggests   that   in\n\n\nfermented   liquor   like   toddy,   presence   of   ethyl   alcohol   upto   12%   is\n\n\nperfectly   legal.     In   these   circumstances,   the   learned   counsel   for   the\n\n\npetitioner submits that in any view  of the matter, these prosecutions\n\n\nare liable to be quashed in as much as the allegations raised even if\n\n\naccepted in toto, do not reveal any culpable offence.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_3\">       3.      The   learned  counsel   for   the   petitioner     was   requested   to\n\n\ntake   instructions.     The   learned   Public   Prosecutor,   after   taking\n\n\ninstructions, concedes that at the relevant point of time, there was no\n\n\nstipulation of law which prescribed that   presence of ethyl alcohol in\n\n\ntoddy   to   an   extent   of   8.69%   and   9.79%   is   an   offence.     There   is   no\n\n\nallegation   that   the   alcohol   found   present   was   not   self   generated   or\n\n\nwas   added   to   toddy.     The   learned   Public   Prosecutor   does   not   make\n\n\nany attempt to support the charge.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_4\">       4.      It   follows   from   the   above   discussions   that   the   petitioner\n\n\ndoes not deserve to stand in trauma of these prosecutions any further.\n</p>\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">Crl.M.C.No.1202/04 &amp; 1203/04            3</span>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"p_5\">       5.    These   Crl.M.Cs   are   in   these   circumstances   allowed.     All\n\n\nfurther   proceedings   in   pursuance   of   crime   Nos.43/01   and   44/01   of\n\n\nPathanapuram   excise   range   against   the   petitioner   are   hereby\n\n\nquashed.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"p_6\">                                                        (R.BASANT, JUDGE)\n\njsr\n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">Crl.M.C.No.1202/04 &amp; 1203/04    4</span>\n\n\f\n         R.BASANT, J\n\n\n\n\n\n           C.R.R.P.No.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"p_7\">              ORDER\n\n\n\n\n\n21ST DAY OF JULY 2006\n\n\f\n</p>",

Sarma on 23 November, 1928</div><div class=\"doc_citations\">Equivalent citations: (1929) 56 MLJ 79</div>\n\n<div class=\"doc_author\">Author: K Sastri</div>\n\n<p id=\"p_1\">JUDGMENT\n \n\n Kumaraswami Sastri, J.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_2\">1. This is an application for review of taxation. The original application was by a notice of motion under <a href=\"/doc/1671917/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 45</a> of the Specific Relief Act for directing the United India Life Assurance Company, Limited, to do certain things. The application is also entitled \"In the matter of the United India Life Assurance Company, Limited\" as required by the rules. But this is not an application under any of the sections of the <a href=\"/doc/257409/\" id=\"a_2\">Indian Companies Act</a>. It is purely an application under <a href=\"/doc/1671917/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 45</a> of the Specific Relief Act. The learned Judge dismissed the application with \"costs,\" but the order as drawn up is \"taxed costs.\"\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_3\">2. The contention raised by the applicant is that the order is wrongly drawn up, inasmuch as the learned Judge did not allow \"taxed costs.\" The other contention is that, as the party did not appear by attorney but only by counsel, he is not entitled to bring in a bill for each item of work done and that all that the Court could do, even if the order as drawn up is right, is to award such costs as are allowable to an advocate appearing in a notice of motion. I think Rule 20 of Order 6 of the Fees Rules only refers to petitions or proceedings under the <a href=\"/doc/257409/\" id=\"a_4\">Indian Companies Act</a>, Probate and Administration matters, petitions under the Guardian and <a href=\"/doc/1608688/\" id=\"a_5\">Wards Act</a>, Income-tax Cases, Habeas Corpus applications, claims to attached properties, application under the <a href=\"/doc/1290078/\" id=\"a_6\">Trustees Act</a>, Administrator-General's Act, arbitrations, and similar matters. I do not think that there is any provision under the rules by which an application under <a href=\"/doc/1671917/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 45</a> of the Specific Relief Act will entitle an Advocate not appearing by Attorney to bring in an itemised bill as has been done in the present case charging for attendance and various other matters as if the Advocate himself was both attorney and advocate. The petitioner's Advocate states that he is willing that the bill may be taxed and does not want an amendment of the order, but his contention is that it should be taxed on the footing of a notice of motion conducted by an Advocate without an attorney and that he is prepared to pay whatever fees the taxing officer will allow on such taxation. I think his contention is right. If the matter does not fall under Order 6, Rule 20 it is clear that the bill such as is brought in by the Advocate for the counter-petitioner cannot stand.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_4\">3. I allow the application and direct the taxing officer to tax the bill on the footing that the order is for taxed costs on a notice of motion presented and conducted by an advocate without an attorney.\n</p>\n \n\n",

Heard Sri.G.Sreekumar, learned counsel for the petitioner and\n\nSri.M.B.Prajith, learned counsel for the 1st respondent. It is conceded\n\nthat the 1st respondent applicant before the MACT has already received\n\nthe award money. But under the award the Insurance Company is given\n\nthe right to recover the amounts from the petitioner who is found to be\n\nthe owner of the vehicle in question.          Sri.G.Sreekumar would submit\n\nthat the document of hire purchase was produced before the MACT and\n\nthat document will clearly show that the transaction between the\n\npetitioner and the other parties was only one of hire purchase. A copy\n\nof the hire purchase agreement was placed before me by\n\nSri.G.Sreekumar and I have gone through the same. Having gone\n\f\nWPC No. 24041 of 2006\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                    2</span>\n\nthrough the hire purchase agreement, I am of the view that the case of\n\nthe petitioner that the petitioner was not the real owner of the vehicle\n\nmerits consideration.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_3\">      Under these circumstances, I set aside Exts.P1 and P2,\n\nHowever, the same is being done only on condition that the petitioner\n\npays a sum of Rs.1,000/- to the High Court Legal Services Committee. I\n\nwould have been inclined to direct payment of cost to the Insurance\n\nCompany also but I am not doing so, since they have not chosen to\n\nenter appearance in this court. Exts.P1 and P2 will stand set aside and\n\nI.A. Nos.2950 and 2949 of 2004 in OP (MV) No.287 of 2000 will stand\n\nallowed on condition that the petitioner pays a sum of Rs.1,000/- to the\n\nHigh Court Legal Services Committee within three weeks of receiving\n\ncopy of this judgment. Once it is seen that the payment is made as\n\ndirected above, the MACT will repost MV(OP) for consideration and\n\ndispose of the same on merits, i.e., in the light of the contentions raised\n\nby the petitioner. The MACT will ensure that the fresh award to be\n\npassed does not cause any prejudice to the 1st respondent in the MACT.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_4\">                                      PIUS C.

This revision has been preferred by the assessee against the judgment dated January 27, 1986, passed by the Sales Tax Tribunal, Varanasi Bench-I, Varanasi, relating to assessment year 1977-78, dismissing the appeal of the assessee. The question raised by Mr. Saran Behari Lal Srivastava before me on behalf of the assessee in the present revision is :\n</p><p id=\"p_3\"> Whether, on the facts and circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was justified in rejecting the books of account on the lone ground that the Surveying Officer was not able to account the cash in till at the time of survey dated 16th July, 1977 ?\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_4\">2. Mr. Saran Behari Lal submitted that the only ground on which the books of account of the assessee have been rejected is that the Surveying Officer was not able to count the cash in till at the time of survey dated 16th July, 1977, and on that ground alone the books of account of the assessee could not be rejected. Mr. Lal has not cited any authority which specifically says that the books of account of an assessee cannot be rejected on the ground that the Surveying Officer was not able to count the cash in till at the time of survey. On the contrary, Mr. Rakesh Ranjan Agarwal, appearing for the Revenue, invited my attention to a decision of this Court in Commissioner of Sales Tax, U.P. v. Narang Ram Chiranji Lal 1970 UPTC 663, in which it was held that where the assessee does not allow the Surveying Officer, at the time of survey, to verify the cash in his till it creates a suspicion in his mind that the money in the till was not in accordance with the accounts maintained by the assessee and rejected the books of account. In view of the said fact, I am of the opinion that the books of account of the assessee could be rejected on the ground that the assessee did not allow the Surveying Officer to count the cash in the till at the time of survey dated 16th July, 1977. The question is answered in favour of the Revenue and against the assessee.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_5\">3. As regards the quantum of turnover Mr. Lal has not been able to point out any material which may indicate that the turnover is either excessive or arbitrary.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_6\">4. No other question has been raised which may require consideration by this Court in the instant revision.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_7\">5. In the result the revision fails and is accordingly rejected. However, there will be no order as to costs.\n</p> \n\n",

The petitioner who is a Mechanic in the respondent department had filed the present petition under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India for quashing the order dated 29th October, 1987 passed by the Commissioner under the Workmen's <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_1\">Compensation Act</a>, 1923 (for short 'the Act') and for a further direction to decide the claim of the petitioner on merits.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_3\">2. The facts of the case are that the petitioner while working as a Mechanic with the respondent department at Sonepat Depot had received personal injuries by an accident which took place on 13th April, 1984 in the course of employment. On the day of the accident, when the petitioner was repairing the bus, the Jack slipped and its Chasis fell on the left hand of the petitioner as a result of which he received serious permanent injury rendering three fingers of his left hand permanently disabled. Thus the petitioner subtained 40 per cent disability. The notice of this accident was given by the petitioner to the General Manager, Haryana Roadways, Sonepat on 12th June, 1984. As the respondent department did not pay any compensation to the petitioner, he was left with no alternative but to file the application for compensation against the Haryana State Roadways, Sonepat Depot on 31st July, 1986 (Annexure P/2) wherein it was stated that he met with an accident on 13th April, 1984 and suffered 40 per cent permanent disability and was thus entitled to get compensation of Rs. 10,800. His claim was registered by the office, in the Register of claims and a notice was issued to the respondent for proceeding with the case. The respondent filed written statement and the following issue was framed.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_4\">Whether the claim of the petitioner is barred by time and if so, what effect ?\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_5\">The Commissioner under the Workmen's <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_2\">Compensation Act</a> refused to entertain the claim on the ground that the same was not made within the period of limitation i.e. two years and rejected the same without any proceedings.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_6\">3. The writ petition was admitted on 13th May, 1988 but the respondent had not filed any written statement. The facts of the case thus remain uncontroverted. Moreso, at the time of final hearing of the petition, none appeared on behalf of the respondent-state.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_7\">4. It was urged that the petitioner had given notice of accident on 12th June, 1984 as per provisions contained in <a href=\"/doc/1998413/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 10(1)</a> of the Workmen Compensation Act and kept on waiting that the Department would consider his claim sympathetically while working with them. Therefore, it was itself a good ground for extension of limitation.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_8\">5. I have considered the submissions made at the bar and perused the paper-book.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_9\">6. The petitioner continued to be in the employment of the respondents on the same salary even after the occurrence He had given notice of the accident on 12th June, 1984 copy of which is annexed as Annexure P-1 to the writ petition as required under Rule 10(1) of the Workmen's <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_4\">Compensation Act</a> and had waited considerably with a hope that his employer would consider his claim sympathetically. The fact that the petitioner continued to be in the employment of the respondents had sufficient cause for not preferring the claim within the prescribed period as he continued to draw the same wages even after sustaining injury during the course of employment and remained under the belief that his employer would settle his claim. <a href=\"/doc/1186300/\" id=\"a_5\">In Said Ahmad v. North Eastern Railway, Lahore</a>, A. I. R. 1940 Lah. 227, it was held that where a workman is re-employed after the accident by the same employer in the same workshop, this fact is itself sufficient cause for not making an application under the Workmen's <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_6\">Compensation Act</a> within the period of limitation. Similarly in <a href=\"/doc/1611611/\" id=\"a_7\">Kesoram Cotton Mills Ltd. v. Bal Gobind</a>, A. I. R. 1953 Calcutta 667, that the workman, whose working capacity was reduced during employment was allowed to continue to be in the employment on lighter job. After some time he was asked to return to his original job on which he had become incapacitated. The Commissioner took the view that the workman had sufficient cause not to provoke a conflict with his employer and not to prefer claim within the limitation so long as his interests were not prejudicially affected and so long as he was receiving a kind of compensation in the shape of lighter work on the same wages.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_10\">7. In view of the foregoing reasons and well settled propositions of law, this writ petition is allowed and the impugned order dated 29th October, 1987 (Annexure P-4) is set aside and the case is remanded back to Respondent No. 1, for deciding the claim of the petitioner on merits expeditiously. The parties are left to bear their own costs.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_11\">8. The petitioner is directed to appear before the Commissioner, Workmen's <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_8\">Compensation Act</a>, Sonepat on 30th October, 1990, for directions.\n</p>\n \n\n",

The claimant, aged 16 years, while travelling in a bus,\n\nsustained injuries in a road accident.         It is noticed that she has\n\nsuffered a split in the anterior teeth. The Tribunal did not accept\n\nExt.A3, which was issued on 8.10.05, relating to some root canal\n\ntreatment. But the Tribunal gave reliance to Ext.A4 issued by the\n\nDental Department of the Medical College.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_2\">         2. It has to be remembered that there was a split in the\n\nteeth of a 16 year old girl and that she had undergone root canal\n\ntreatment. There was also suspicion of a fracture of the mandible.\n\nSo all these things would indicate that the girl had undergone\n\ntreatment in one or two hospitals. Taking note of the injury, that too\n\nof a young girl on her teeth at the age of 16, I feel that an amount of\n\nRs.2,000/- can be enhanced towards loss of amenities and\n\nenjoyment in life.

The petitioner has been arraigned as third accused in a case under <a href=\"/doc/1169411/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 13(2)</a> r/w <a href=\"/doc/669669/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 13(1)(e)</a> of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and under <a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 109</a> of the Indian Penal Code r/w <a href=\"/doc/1259316/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 13(2)</a> r/w <a href=\"/doc/669669/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 13(1)(e)</a> of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 launched totally against 20 accused.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_6\">5. The learned Special Judge, having taken cognizance of the aforesaid case, issued summons to all the accused to appear on 29.7.2005. The case thereafter stood posted to 23.9.2005 and then to 25.1.2006. As some of the accused were found absent, non-bailable warrants were issued after the petitions filed under <a href=\"/doc/1009979/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 317</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure for condoning their absence were dismissed.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_7\">6. The other absentee accused, except the third accused, surrendered and the non-bailable warrants issued against them were recalled. The third accused, who has not chosen to show up before the Court in spite of the non-bailable warrant pending against her, has filed the aforesaid petitions under <a href=\"/doc/56864/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 70(2)</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure to recall the non-bailable warrant, under <a href=\"/doc/1009979/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 317</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure to condone her absence and under <a href=\"/doc/1245435/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 205</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure to dispense with her presence and permit her to appear by her Pleader.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_8\">7. The learned trial Judge, having adverted to the various authorities ruling the subject, returned a decision that the petitioner against whom non-bailable warrant is pending, cannot seek for the reliefs under <a href=\"/doc/56864/\" id=\"a_13\">Sections 70(2)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1009979/\" id=\"a_14\">317</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1245435/\" id=\"a_15\">205</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_9\">8. Learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that the petitioner, who is an Octogenarian aged 87 years, is suffering from serious ailment and therefore she could not attend the Court.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_10\">9. The learned Public Prosecutor would submit that the petitioner is hale and healthy and she avoids receiving the copies of the documents and statements under <a href=\"/doc/1613898/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 207</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure just to facilitate the other accused to drag on the matter.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_11\">10. On a perusal of the records, it is found that the case was originally registered way back in the year 1996, but the chargesheet was laid only in the year 2005. The trial Court has given ample opportunity for the present accused to appear before the Court to receive the copies of the documents and statements under <a href=\"/doc/1613898/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 207</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure. But the accused has not turned up to receive the copies of documents and statements. The learned Special Judge has chosen to issue non-bailable warrant as against the petitioner to compel her presence before the Court to comply with the mandates of the provision under <a href=\"/doc/1613898/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 207</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure in letter and spirit.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_12\">11. Of Course, the Court has ample power to dispense with the appearance/attendance of the accused on a particular hearing when the accused is represented by a Pleader under <a href=\"/doc/1009979/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 317</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure and to dispense with the personal attendance of the accused and permit the accused to appear by her Pleader under <a href=\"/doc/1245435/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 205</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_13\">12. But the power of the Court to compel the attendance of the accused, even such concession or accommodation is granted to the accused whenever it is quite necessary for the purpose of an enquiry or trial of the case, is recognised under the scheme<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_21\"> of the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_14\">13. When <a href=\"/doc/1613898/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 207</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure specifically refers to furnishing of the copies of police report and other documents only to the accused, the presence of the accused when the matter has been posted for furnishing the copy of the police report and other documents is very much necessary.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_15\">14. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/195380/\" id=\"a_23\">V.K. Jain v. Union of India</a> 2000 SCC (CRI) 302 and in <a href=\"/doc/1021734/\" id=\"a_24\">R. Annapurna v. Ramadugu Anantha Krishna Sastry</a> 2004 SCC (Cri) 1135 recognised the power of the Court to compel the attendance of the accused whenever such attendance becomes imperatively needed. For receiving the copy of the police report and other documents and for answering the questionnaire framed under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 313</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the presence of the third accused is quite necessary.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_16\">15. In a case where the accused undertook before the Hon'ble Supreme Court that the accused would not make any statement under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 313</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure and would not raise any question of prejudice, if any, caused to him due to non-examination under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 313</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure at any subsequent stage of trial, appeal or revision, the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in <a href=\"/doc/294179/\" id=\"a_28\">Chandu Lal Chandraker v. Puran Mal</a> 1988 SCC (Cri) 907, has directed to dispense with the presence of the accused at the time of making statement under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 313</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure. \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_17\">16. Even when the personal appearance of the accused is dispensed with under <a href=\"/doc/1245435/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 205</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure whenever there is necessity for her personal attendance, the same can be enforced. In a case where the learned Judicial Magistrate adopted uniform policy of dismissing the petitions under <a href=\"/doc/1245435/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 205</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a Division Bench of this Court in A.S.K. Rama Iyer v. T. Kannan 1980 L.W. Crl. 31 has observed that such a learned Judicial Magistrate will refuse permission to the accused to appear by his Pleader as contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/1245435/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 205</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure even if the accused is in death-bed, adhering blindly and undeviatingly to some unreasonable principle.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_18\">17. Only in an extreme and exceptional circumstance brought to the satisfaction of the Court that the accused is unable to appear before the Court, the Court may consider the request to dispense with his presence under <a href=\"/doc/1245435/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 205</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it has been ruled by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Lily Begum v. Joy Chandra Nagbanshi 1994 SCC (Cri) 303.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_19\">18. It is a well settled proposition of law that the power to grant exemption from a personal appearance is totally discretionary and once the discretion is judiciously exercised by the trial Court, the same cannot be interfered with in revision merely because the accused feels aggrieved by the order passed by the trial Court.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_20\">19. There is a non-bailable warrant pending against the petitioner. The petitioner has to appear before the trial Judge to recall the warrant under <a href=\"/doc/56864/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 70(2)</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Unless she makes her appearance and the warrant is recalled, it would be a mockery of judicial process if her application filed either under <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 317</a> or under <a href=\"/doc/1245435/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 205</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure is entertained.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_21\">20. The medical certificate produced by the petitioner to show that she is suffering from ailment at the ripe old age is seriously disputed by the respondent-police. Therefore, the petitioner has to appear and invoke <a href=\"/doc/56864/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 70(2)</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure to recall the warrant issued against her.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_22\">21. The Court holds that the hearing posted for furnishing copy of the final report and documents collected by the Investigating Agency is a very crucial hearing where the participation of the accused is contemplated under the scheme<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_38\"> of the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure. She cannot refuse to participate in such process of furnishing copy of final report and documents to her.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_23\">22. The petitions filed by the petitioner under <a href=\"/doc/1009979/\" id=\"a_39\">Sections 317</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1245435/\" id=\"a_40\">205</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, when the non-bailable warrant is pending against her, are found not sustainable. The trial of a case, which originated way back in the year 1996, cannot be further postponed on account of the non-participation and non-cooperation of the petitioner herein. She cannot delegate her function of receipt of copies furnished under <a href=\"/doc/1613898/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 207</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure to the Advocate of her choice. She must be present to receive the copy of the final report and documents to set the trial process to move further.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_24\">23. The learned Special Judge has rightly concluded that all the three petitions as detailed above are not maintainable.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_25\">24. Such a common order passed by the learned trial Judge is found not tainted with any illegality or irregularity. No interference therefore is warranted.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_26\">25. In the result, Crl.R.C.Nos. 191 to 193 of 2006 stand dismissed. Consequently, connected criminal miscellaneous petitions also stand dismissed.\n</p> \n\n",

This appeal has been preferred against order of\n\nlearned Single Judge, dismissing the writ petition against order of\n\nthe Labour Court declining to enforce award for backwages for\n\nthe period during which the workman was proved to be gainfully\n\nemployed.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_2\">2.          The appellant was employed with the management,\n\nrunning a private hospital, where he worked from 1978 to 1996\n\nwhen his services were terminated.       He raised an industrial\n\ndispute against the order of termination, which was referred for\n\nadjudication to the Labour Court. The Labour Court vide award\n\ndated 26.3.2003, set aside the order of termination and directed\n\nreinstatement of the workman with continuity of service and full\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\"> LPA No.720 of 2009                                                   2</span>\n\n\n\n\nbackwages. It was held that no inquiry was held, which rendered\n\nthe termination of service to be illegal. Thereafter, the workman\n\nfiled an application under <a href=\"/doc/483633/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 33-C(2)</a> of the Industrial\n\nDisputes Act, 1947 for computation of monetary benefits flowing\n\nfrom the award. The application was opposed with a plea that the\n\nworkman was gainfully employed with Kapil Vohra Eye Hospital,\n\nAmbala City after his services were terminated and prior to his\n\nreinstatement and for that period, he was not entitled to\n\nbackwages.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_3\">3.          The Labour Court vide order dated 6.12.2007 partly\n\nallowed the application, except for the period he was gainfully\n\nemployed.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_4\">4.          The workman filed writ petition in this Court, giving\n\nrise to the impugned order and submitted that once the award\n\nwas made in his favour, which became final, he was entitled to\n\nwages for the entire period irrespective of his being gainfully\n\nemployed and thus, he could not be denied backwages from\n\n19.6.1996 to 23.12.2004, during which he was gainfully\n\nemployed. Learned Single Judge rejected this claim, holding that\n\nthe claim of the workman was based on a fraud, on which ground\n\nbenefit of award could be partly declined inspite of its finality.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">5.          On the last date of hearing, none appeared for the\n\nappellant. Even today, none appears for the appellant. We have\n\nperused the record.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_6\">6.          Learned Single Judge observed:-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\"> LPA No.720 of 2009                                                  3</span><p id=\"p_7\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">                \"XX           XX           XX           XX              X\n                A perusal of the writ petition clearly shows that the\n          workman has neither denied that he was gainfully\n          employed from 2002 onwards nor has he pleaded that he\n          was unemployed for the period for which the Labour Court\n          has held him gainfully employed and on this ground\n          rejected his claim of back-wages. What has been asserted in\n          the writ petition by the petitioner is that the Labour Court\n          could not go beyond the award and, therefore, the\n          petitioner-workman was entitled to full back wages from\n          19.6.1996 i.e. the date of termination till 23.12.2004 i.e. the\n          day before his date of reinstatement. This clearly brings out\n          the lust of the workman to gain undue benefit which he is\n          not entitled to. The back wages are granted to a workman\n          who due to his illegal termination by the employer\n          remained unemployed or who is not gainfully employed.\n          The Management has been able to prove that the workman\n          was indeed gainfully employed from 2002 onwards, and,\n          therefore, what is being claimed by the workman beyond\n          2001 till 23.12.2004 was undue benefit which under law he\n          cannot be held entitled to. The Labour Court while\n          exercising its powers under <a href=\"/doc/759209/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 33-C</a> (2) of the Act has\n          not over-stepped the limits as prescribed under the Statute\n          nor has it ventured out the limitations as culled out by the\n          judgments referred to by the counsel for the petitioner or\n          the Management. It has merely, while exercising its powers\n          under <a href=\"/doc/759209/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 33-C</a> (2) of the Act, given effect to the award\n          passed by the Labour Cout on 26.3.2003 (Annexure P-1) on\n          which the claim of the workman is based. Since the period\n          for which the workman is entitled to back wages was not\n          specified in the award, the Labour Court on the basis of the\n          evidence led by the parties, has determined the period for\n          which the workman had remained unemployed and has\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\"> LPA No.720 of 2009                                                 4</span>\n\n\n\n\n           accordingly granted him the benefit of back wages for the\n           said period. This, by no stretch of imagination, can be said\n           to be beyond the jurisdiction of the Labour Court while\n           exercising powers under <a href=\"/doc/759209/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 33-C</a> (2) of the Act.\"\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">7.         It is, thus, clear that the workman was gainfully\n\nemployed for the period in dispute, for which backwages have\n\nbeen declined.   Even though finality of an award may not be\n\ndisturbed and findings recorded may be resjudicata, we are\n\nunable to find any error in the view taken by learned Single Judge\n\nthat the claim of the workman for the period he was proved to be\n\ngainfully employed was vitiated by fraud, relying on judgment of\n\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court in S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu (dead) by\n\n<a href=\"/doc/113963352/\" id=\"a_5\">L.Rs. v. Jagannath</a> (dead) by L.Rs. and others AIR 1994 SC Court\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">853.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">8.         We, thus, do not find any ground to interfere with the\n\nview taken by the learned Single Judge.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">9.

The Assessing Officer did not accept the claim\nof the assessee. Order of the Assessing Officer was set\naside by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner of\nIncome tax. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner held\nthat the amount of incentive bonus was an \"income from\nprofession\". The assessee was, therefore, in consonance\nwith the Board's circular no. 1774 dated 29th September\n1987 entitled to a deduction of 40% claimed by him. The\nchallenge to the appellate order before the Income Tax\nAppellate Tribunal failed.    The tribunal held that the\nincentive bonus cannot be treated as a part of salary and\nthat it is a professional income. The tribunal directed the\nAssessing Officer to allow 40% deduction from the\nincentive bonus.\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">           The present Reference is made at the instance\nof the Revenue for resolution of the following questions\nof law:-\n</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">     \"1.

She has submitted that the\nabove-referred questions are no more res integra. This\ncourt (Coram: Chandramauli Kr. Prasad, J, as he then\nwas, and Jayanandan Singh, J.) has decided the issue in\nthe matter of the Commissioner of Income Tax, Bihar,\nPatna Vs. Ramjee Prasad ( Tax Case No.13 of 1991).\nBy the judgment and order dated 7th February 2008, this\ncourt has held as under:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">     \"The incentive bonus given to the assessee was\n     not granted by the Life Insurance Corporation\n     of India for the purposes as set out in <a href=\"/doc/130958/\" id=\"a_2\">Section\n     10(14)</a> of the Act.        Once it is held so the\n     assessee cannot claim deduction at the rate of\n     40% taking shelter behind <a href=\"/doc/130958/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 10(14)</a> of\n     the Act.       We are of the opinion that no\n     provision other than <a href=\"/doc/130958/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 10(14)</a> of the Act\n     exists   for       allowing   deduction   towards\n     expenditure of the nature claimed by the\n     assessee. Incentive bonus or part thereof is not\n     reimbursement of expenditure by the employer\n     to qualify for deduction under <a href=\"/doc/130958/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 10(14)</a>\n     of the Act. We are of the opinion that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                     4</span>\n\n\n\n\n     expenditure under <a href=\"/doc/130958/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 10(14)</a> of the Act\n     can be allowed only when it is granted to meet\n     expenses       wholly     and     exclusively      in\n     performance of the duty and that too to the\n     extent such expenses are actually incurred for\n     that purpose.\"\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">              Learned Advocate Mr Ajay Kumar Rastogi\nhas appeared for the assessee. At the outset, he has\nchallenged the maintainability of the present Reference.\n</blockquote><p id=\"p_9\">He has submitted that the Government of India has taken\na conscious decision under its communication dated 27th\nMarch 2000 not to file appeal before the High Court\nunless the tax effect exceeds Rs. 2 lakhs. The said\ninstruction   has   since    been   modified.   Under    the\ncommunication dated 24th October 2005, the above-\nreferred monetary limit of Rs. 2 lakhs has been raised to\nRs. 4 lakhs. He has submitted that the aforesaid\ninstruction would apply not only to the appeals to be filed\nthereafter but also to the appeals/references pending on\nthe date. He has submitted that as in the present case the\ntax effect is less than the aforesaid monetary limit, the\ncase requires to be dismissed. In support, he has relied\nupon the judgment of the Bombay High Court in the\nmatter of Commissioner of Income-Tax Vs. Pithwa\nEngg. Works (276 ITR 519).\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">              In the above-referred matter, the Bombay\nHigh Court relied upon the instruction dated 27th March\n2000 in an Income Tax Reference filed in the year 1988.\nThe Bombay High Court held,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                   5</span>\n\n\n\n\n        \"The above instructions dated March 27,\n      2000 reflect the policy decision taken by the\n      Board not to raise questions of law where the\n      tax effect is less than the amount prescribed in\n      the above circular with a view to reduce\n      litigations before the High Courts and the\n      Supreme Court. The said circular is binding\n      on the Revenue though learned counsel tried\n      to contend that the said circular is not\n      applicable to the old referred cases. However,\n      he could not take his submission to a logical\n      end.\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">         One fails to understand how the Revenue\n      can contend that so far as new cases are\n      concerned, the circular issued by the Board is\n      binding on them and in compliance with the\n      said instructions, they do not file references if\n      the tax effect is less than Rs. 2 lakhs. But the\n      same approach is not adopted with respect to\n      the old referred cases even if the tax effect is\n      less than Rs. 2 lakhs. In our view, there is no\n      logic behind this approach.\"\n</p><p id=\"p_12\">             We are unable to agree with the opinion of\nthe Bombay High Court. The Government of India has\ndecided that appeals would be filed only in cases where\nthe tax effect exceeded the revised monetary limit given\nthereunder, that necessarily means that those instructions\nwould apply to the appeals/references which were yet to\nbe filed or, in other words, the appeals/references filed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                    6</span>\n\n\n\n\nafter 27th March 2000. In our opinion, the High Court\ncannot    refuse       to   consider   and   decide   the\nappeals/references which are already filed and pending\nbefore the High Court for decision taking shelter under\nthe above-referred instruction dated 27th March 2000 or\nany other instruction of similar nature.\n</p><p id=\"p_13\">           Mr Rastogi has next submitted that the above-\nreferred judgment in the matter of Ramjee Prasad is per\nincuriam the decision of the Gujarat High Court in the\nmatter of Commissioner of Income-Tax Vs. Kiranbhai\nH. Shelat &amp; Anr. (235 ITR 635). He has submitted that\nthe Gujarat High Court has in no uncertain terms held\nthat the Development Officers of the Corporation are\nentitled to deduct actual expenses incurred by them to the\nmaximum of 30% from the amount of the incentive\nbonus received by them from the Corporation.\n</p><p id=\"p_14\">           In the matter of Ramjee Prasad, identical\nquestion of law was referred to this Court. This Court\nfollowed the judgments of the Full Bench of the\nKarnataka High Court in the matter of Commissioner of\nIncome-Tax Vs. M.D. Patil [1998 (220) ITR 71] and of\nthe Madhya Pradesh High Court in the cases of\nCommissioner of Income-Tax Vs. A.K. Ghosh [(2003)\n263 ITR 536] and of Commissioner of Income-Tax Vs.\nGurudeo Singh Jaggi [(2004) 267 ITR 763]. The\naforesaid High Courts have taken a consistent view that\nthe amount of incentive bonus received by the\nDevelopment Officers of the Corporation is not referable\nto and is not exempt under <a href=\"/doc/130958/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 10(14)</a> of the Act, but\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                   7</span>\n\n\n\n\nis a `salary' within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1839790/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 17(1)(iv)</a> of\nthe Act. The only deduction admissible will be the\nstandard deduction available under <a href=\"/doc/1509588/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 16</a> of the Act.\nThe appeal preferred against the above-referred judgment\nof the High Court of Madhya Pradesh was not entertained\nby the Hon'ble Supreme Court.\n</p><p id=\"p_15\">          The Gujarat High Court also has the same\nview insofar as <a href=\"/doc/130958/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 10(14)</a> of the Act is concerned. It\nhas been held that the incentive bonus is a salary within\nthe meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1839790/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 17(1)(iv)</a> of the Act. It further\nheld, \"the Development Officer can still demonstrate\nthat he was required to incur the expenditure as a\npart of his duty to enable himself to realize the\nproceeds of the Incentive bonus. Thus, for working\nout the amount of profit in addition to salary, there\nwould be deduction from the gross Incentive bonus,\nexpenses properly incurred in realizing it. This\ndeduction would be warranted to reach the profit\nelement cannot be denied to the assessee-employee on\nthe ground that the statutory deductions are already\nprovided in <a href=\"/doc/1509588/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 16</a>.\"\n</p><p id=\"p_16\">          In view of the aforesaid discussion, it was\ndecided that the Development Officer of the Corporation\nwas entitled to deduction of the actual expenses incurred\nby him up to a maximum limit of 30% of the amount and\nthat the net amount after such deduction is the salary\nincome.\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">          We may first note that the judgment of the\nGujarat High Court is not a binding precedent. The\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                   8</span>\n\n\n\n\njudgment in the matter of Ramjee Prasad (supra) cannot\nbe said to be per incuriam as submitted by Mr Rastogi.\nFurther the reliance placed on the Board's circular no.\n1774 dated 29th September 1987 was also uncalled for.\nThe said circular no. 1774 is placed before us. It is\napparent that it contains a clarification of its earlier\ncircular no. 1546 dated 6th January 1984. It only clarifies\nthat the earlier instruction was issued in respect of the\ncommission earned by the insurance agents and that it\ndid not apply to the Development Officers of the\nCorporation, who are full time employees of the\nCorporation and are in receipt of regular salary. It has\nbeen reiterated that \"the payment received by the\nDevelopment Officers as incentive bonus or bonus\ncommission (or by any other name) is for the work\ndone for the employer.

The petitioner has been convicted of an offence under <a href=\"/doc/48127346/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 161</a> of the Indian Penal Code read with <a href=\"/doc/609127/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 116</a>. His contention is that on the facts found the offence has not been established.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_3\">2. The facts found are that on 15th November, 1925, he, a Municipal Councillor of the Wallajapet Municipal Council, did, in a letter written to the complainant, who was the manager of the office of the same Municipality, say to him, \"The matter regarding the lock-up shed, Mr. Manicka Seshayya is keen about it. Will you 'just try that job for him? I now here take my full privelege to you to say that he makes an offer of rupees two hundred to you in case he gets it. I shall stand surety for it if you can interfere in the matter and have it settled. If you can assure me, he is prepared to deposit the amount\". The giving of a contract for this lock-up shed lay with the Chairman and the Councillors. I have no doubt what this letter means. The petitioner informs the manager that if he uses his influence with the Chairman and Councillors to secure the contract for Manicka Seshayya, he will get Rs. 200 from Manicka Seshayya or, if not from him, then from himself, the petitioner. That is, in effect he says,, \"I, at any rate, will see that you get Rs. 200 if you get the contract for Manicka Seshayya\". That is equivalent to an offer of Rs. 200 if he gets the contract for him. I am not able to support the contention that this is a merely passing on of an offer by Manicka Seshayya himself. It is clearly an undertaking by the petitioner himself that he will, if necessary, pay this Rs. 200 when the contract is obtained. I am clear therefore that this is an offer by the petitioner of an illegal gratification to the complainant in his capacity as manager of the Municipal Office, to use the influence he possesses in such capacity over the Chairman and Councillors in order to procure this Municipal contract for Manicka Seshayya.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_4\">3. It is next contended that even so petitioner's conduct does not amount to an abetment of an offence under <a href=\"/doc/48127346/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 161</a>, first because even if complainant had accepted the bribe he would not have committed an offence under that section and therefore there cannot be any abetment of such an offence, secondly that petitioner's conduct did not amount to a real offer and thirdly that at the most his conduct amounted to a mere abetment of an attempt or an instigation of an abetment. He further raised the question whether the complainant is a public servant. That point however was never raised in the Courts below where it was not disputed that he was a public servant. Whether he is or is not is a question of fact and I am not prepared to let it be raised here for the first time and I take it that the complainant is a public servant.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_5\">4. The essence of the first contention is that the complainant was not asked to do an official act since officially he has nothing to do with such a contract, but <a href=\"/doc/48127346/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 161</a> is not confined to cases in which the gratification is taken for doing an official act. The wording of the section is clumsy, but it does not appear to me to be so restricted. From that wording and omitting words which are. superflous for this argument it is an offence if a public servant accepts any gratification other than legal remuneration as a motive or reward for rendering or attempting to render any service to any one with any public servant as such. Now here on the facts if the complainant, the manager of the Municipal Office and a public servant, had accepted the Rs. 200 as a reward for using his influence with the Chairman and the Councillors as such to get a contract for Manicka Seshayya, which contract was in the gift of the Chairman and Councillors as such, I have no doubt that he would be guilty under <a href=\"/doc/48127346/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 161</a>, whether or not the act which he did was an official act. Incidentally I can see no reason for supposing that what the Chairman and Councillors as a body do or can do officially they do not do as a public servant.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_6\">5. As to the second contention, it is not necessary that the gratification need actually be produced. I have already held that petitioner was obviously making a firm offer to pay the complainant Rs. 200 if Manicka Seshayya got the contract through his good services. As to the third contention, the petitioner offered the gratification and although the complainant did not accept it, petitioner would still be guilty under <a href=\"/doc/609127/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 116</a>. See illustration (a) to that section. That illustration no doubt deals with an offer for a bribe to a public servant for showing favour in the exercise of his official functions. But the principle of the illustration obviously applies as much to the other purposes set out in <a href=\"/doc/48127346/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 161</a> as to doing or forbearing to do any official act.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_7\">6. It is pleaded that the charge framed was obscure, but so far from that being the case, it seems to me to set out clearly the exact conduct contemplated in the latter part of <a href=\"/doc/48127346/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 161</a> so as to bring the abetment by the petitioner under <a href=\"/doc/609127/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 116</a>. The charge runs that 'You offered illegal gratification of Rs. 200 to Rajam Aiyar, manager, Municipal Office, Wallajapet, as a motive or reward for rendering a service to Manicka Seshayya with the Chairman and Councillors, to wit, to procure for Manicka Seshayya the contract of a lock-up shed\". It has been quite clearly framed with an eye to that part of <a href=\"/doc/48127346/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 161</a> which is applicable to the case.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_8\">7. Petitioner calls in aid a ruling of a Bench of the Bombay High Court reported in <a href=\"/doc/1312653/\" id=\"a_11\">Emperor v. Amir-ud-din</a> (1922) 24 Bom. LR 534, but there, as will be seen, there was no offer by the accused himself. He merely stated that some one else was willing to bribe. In the present case the petitioner himself made an offer in what he guaranteed the money if the favour was granted. The case in Upendranath Chowdhury v. The King-Emperor (1916) 21 CWN 552 is distinguishable on the ground that the money taken there was not for rendering service with any pubic servant as such. The case in Venkiah, In re (1924) 47 MLJ 662 has been relied upon. But there the facts again do not show that the kurnam took the money for rendering a service with any public servant as such and therefore the conviction could not stand unless it was proved that he took it for doing an official act which was held not proved on the facts. None of these cases therefore are of any assistance to the petitioner. I therefore do not see that any error of law has been committed by the Lower Courts and the conviction is proper and must stand.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_9\">8. I am asked to reduce the sentence, but having regard to the necessity for severely punishing attempts to foul the purity of official administration, I am not prepared to interfere. I therefore dismiss this petition.\n</p> \n\n",

The brief facts of the case are the following:\n\n     The appellant was an employee of the 1st respondent Bank.\n\nHe was dismissed from service on 29.7.1972. In 1989, she filed\n\na Shop Appeal against the said order before the Deputy Labour\n\nCommissioner. As per the provisions of Section 18 of the Kerala\n\nShops and Commercial Establishments Act, 1960, the appeal\n\nshould have been filed within six months.            The appellate\n\nauthority has got the power to condone delay upto six months.\n\nThat means, in any event, the appeal should have been filed\n\nwithin one year from the date of dismissal. But, it was filed in\n\n1989. The appellate authority even before issuing notice to the\n\n1st respondent condoned the delay.               The 1st respondent\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">W.A.No.209/2006                  2</span>\n\n\nappeared and contested.       The Shop Appeal was allowed by\n\nExt.P9 order. Challenging that order, the Original Petition was\n\nfiled by the 1st respondent. The learned Single Judge found that\n\nthe Shop Appeal filed after one year was not maintainable and\n\ntherefore quashed Ext.P9. Aggrieved by the said judgment of\n\nthe learned Single Judge, this Writ Appeal is filed.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">      2.   The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that\n\nthe bank has not challenged the order of the shop appellate\n\nauthority to condone the delay in filing the appeal. Secondly, it is\n\nsubmitted that all the criminal cases filed against her by the\n\nbank ended only by 1989. She was acquitted of all offences.\n\nOnly thereafter, she could have filed the appeal. Therefore, the\n\nappellate authority rightly entertained the appeal, it is\n\nsubmitted.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_7\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">      3.   The delay in filing the appeal was condoned before\n\nissuing notice to the 1st respondent or filing written statement by\n\nit. It appears to be an order passed at the time of presentation of\n\nthe appeal. If the 1st respondent is aggrieved by that order, it\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">W.A.No.209/2006                 3</span>\n\n\nneed challenge it, if only, the final order in the appeal goes\n\nagainst it. When Ext.P9 final order was passed against it, the 1st\n\nrespondent has challenged the order condoning delay also. For\n\nchallenging that order, the Bank need not approach this Court\n\nseparately.    So, the 1st contention fails. The 2nd contention is\n\nalso equally untenable. When the statute says that the appeal\n\nshould be filed within six months and if there is further delay the\n\nappellate authority can condone the delay only up to six months,\n\nany appeal filed thereafter is not maintainable. The fact that\n\nsome criminal cases were pending against the appellant is not a\n\nvalid ground to get over the bar of limitation under the statute.\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">     In the result, the Writ Appeal fails and it is dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">                           (K.BALAKRISHNAN NAIR, JUDGE)\n\n\n\n\n                             (M.L.JOSEPH FRANCIS, JUDGE)\nps\n\f\n</p>",

In this proceeding before the Central Government, transferred to the Tribunal and heard as an Appeal pursuant to <a href=\"/doc/46647246/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 131B</a> of the Customs Act, 1962, the Appellant impugnes the levy of countervailing duty at 20% ad valorem in terms of Item I(iii) of the Schedule to the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations (Excise Duty) Act, 1955 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) on an imported consignment of Pethidine Hydrochloride.\n</p>  \n\n<p id=\"p_3\">2. The grounds urged in support of the Appeal, inter alia, are as follows ;\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_4\">(a) The consignment was imported and not manufactured in India as envisaged in <a href=\"/doc/169382/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 3</a> of the Act and there could be no levy of any duty on the imported consignment in question under the Act ;\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_5\">(b) In any event, the consignment in question was not \"dutiable goods\" as denned in <a href=\"/doc/150912830/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 2(c)</a> of the Act, since it did not conform to the description in Item I(iii) of the Schedule to the Act. [\"medicinal preparation\" not containing alcohol but containing narcotic drug or narcotic],\n \n\n</p><p id=\"p_6\">3. We have heard Shri M.V. Rajadhyaksha, Advocate for the Appellant and Mrs. Zutshi for the Respondent at length.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_7\">4. The first of the aforesaid grounds would appear to be clearly misconceived. The levy was, in fact, an additional duty (generally known as countervailing duty) in terms of <a href=\"/doc/345301/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 3</a> of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 read with the provisions of the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations Act and not one under the latter enactment simpliciter.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_8\">5. In terms of <a href=\"/doc/345301/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 3</a> of the Customs Tariff Act, an imported article becomes exigible to an additional duty equal to the excise duty for the time being leviable on a like article if produced or manufactured in India. The explanation to the aforesaid provision clarifies that if a like article is not so produced or manufactured, the additional duty shall be equal to the excise duty leviable on the class or description of articles to which the imported article belongs.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_9\">6. If, therefore, the imported consignment in question is a medicinal preparation containing narcotic drug or narcotic in terms of the description contained in Item I(iii) of the Schedule to the Act, the levy of \"additional duty\" at the rate specified in the aforesaid item is attracted pursuant to <a href=\"/doc/345301/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 3</a> of the Customs Tariff Act, regardless of the fact that it was actually imported and no like article is manufactured in India.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_10\">7. The crux of the issue is, thus, if Pethidine Hydrochloride is a \"medicinal preparation containing narcotic drug or narcotic\" and this brings us to ground No. (2) set out in para 2(b) supra.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_11\">8. In a brief compass, the argument for the petitioner was :\n</p>  \n\n<p id=\"p_12\">(a) in terms of <a href=\"/doc/127314/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 2(g)</a> of the Act, \"medicinal preparations\" includes all drugs, which are a remedy or prescription prepared for internal or external use of human beings or animals and all substances intended to be used for or in the treatment, mitigation or prevention of disease in human beings or animals ;\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_13\">(b) the consignment in question was not a remedy or a prescription prepared for internal or external use of human beings or animals in as much as it cannot be used straightaway without further processing into injections or tablets, etc. ;\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_14\">(c) nor is it a \"substance\" in the light of the ratio of the decision of the Supreme Court in A.I.R. 1963 S.C. 665 [(1963)2 SCJ 322 - <a href=\"/doc/885435/\" id=\"a_8\">Chimanlal Jagjivandas Sheth v. State of Maharashtra</a>] wherein construing the definition of \"Drug\" in <a href=\"/doc/798638/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 3(b)</a> of the Drugs Act, 1940 which is in pari-materia with the definition of \"medicinal preparations\" in the Act, their Lordships had drawn a distinction between \"Medicine\" and \"substances\" which are not medicines strictly so-called and held the appropriate meaning of the expression \"substances\" to be \"things\" which are other than medicines but are used for or in treatment ;\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_15\">(d) if, therefore, the imported consignment is neither a \"drug\"--not being a remedy or prescription-nor a substance, it cannot be a \"medicinal preparation\" exigible to duty under the Act;\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_16\">(e) in any view, applying the rule of strict construction of taxing provisions (A.LR. 1971 S.C.378-<a href=\"/doc/497014/\" id=\"a_10\">Baidyanath Ayurveda Bhavan v. Excise Commissioner, U.P</a>.), even if the consignment was a \"medicinal preparation\", unless it contains narcotic drug or narcotic in terms of Item I(iii) of the Schedule to the Act, it cannot attract duty. While a \"medicinal preparation\" containing narcotic like pethidine will attract duty, pethidine hydrochloride (the imported consignment) will not be liable to duty, inasmuch as it is the narcotic itself and cannot be, therefore, a \"medicinal preparation\" containing a .narcotic.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_17\">9. Counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, contended that the definition of \"medicinal preparations\" in <a href=\"/doc/127314/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 2(g)</a> of the Act is inclusive of both drugs and substances and \"substance\" is much wider in its scope and amplitude and include \"drugs\". She invited our attention to the meanings given to \"substance\" and \"drugs\" in the Dictionery of Science &amp; Technology W&amp;R Chambers, 1971 and contended that the consignment in question was a substance falling within the definition of \"medicinal preparations\" in <a href=\"/doc/127314/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 2(g)</a> of the Act and within Item I(iii) of the Schedule to the Act since it was a narcotic itself.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_18\">10. A \"narcotic drug\" or \"narcotic\" had been defined to mean a substance, other than alcohol, which, when swallowed or inhaled by or injected into, a human being, induces drowsiness, sleep, stupefaction or insensibility in the human being and includes alkaloids of opium. [<a href=\"/doc/127314/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 2(h)</a> of the Act]. Pethidine Hydrochloride, the imported consignment in question is, indisputably, a \"narcotic\", used as an analgesic in the form of injections or tablets.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_19\">11. A \"medicinal preparation\", however, had been defined to include-\n</p>  \n\n<p id=\"p_20\">(i) all drugs which are a remedy or prescription prepared for internal or external use of human being or animals ; and\n \n\n</p><p id=\"p_21\">(ii) all substances intended to be used for in the treatment, mitigation or prevention of disease in human beings or animals.\n</p><p id=\"p_22\">[<a href=\"/doc/127314/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 2(g)</a> of the Act] \n \n\n</p><p id=\"p_23\">12. It would follow from an analysis of the aforesaid definitions that a \"narcotic drug\" or \"narcotic\" is a \"medicinal preparation\"-\n</p>  \n\n<p id=\"p_24\">(a) if a \"drug\", when put to the internal or external use of human beings or animals-\n</p>  \n\n<p id=\"p_25\">(i) by itself, as a remedy ; or\n \n\n</p><p id=\"p_26\">(ii) in conjunction with other drugs or substances as in a prepared prescription ; or\n \n\n</p><p id=\"p_27\">(b) as a substance if intended to be used for or in the treatment, mitigation or prevention of disease in human beings or animals.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_28\">13. In any view, a \"narcotic\" being a substance, even as per the definition, will qualify to be a \"medicinal preparation\", if it is intended to be used for or in the treatment, mitigation or prevention of disease in human beings or animals. That the imported consignment was intended to be so used is not in controversy. It was, consequently, a \"medicinal preparation\" within the scope of the meaning given to the said expression in <a href=\"/doc/127314/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 2(g)</a> of the Act, even if it is not actually a \"drug\" being a readymade remedy or prescription.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_29\">14. In the Supreme Court case cited [<a href=\"/doc/885435/\" id=\"a_16\">Chimanlal Jagjivandas Sheth v. State of Maharashtra</a>- A.I.R. 1963 S.C. 665], it was \"drug\" that was defined to include-\n</p>  \n\n<p id=\"p_30\">(a) medicines for internal or external use of human beings or animals ;\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_31\">(b) all substances intended to be used for or in treatment, mitigation or prevention of disease in human beings or animals other than medicines ; and\n \n\n</p><p id=\"p_32\">(c) such substances (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the human body, etc,\n \n\n</p><p id=\"p_33\">15. It is fairly obvious that while the contradistinction in the Supreme Court case was between medicines for internal or external use and substances other than medicines, no such contradistinction would appear to arise between \"drugs\" and \"substances\" simpliciter in terms of <a href=\"/doc/127314/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 2(g)</a> of the Act, in view of the absence of words specifically excluding \"drugs\" from \"substances\". Assuming, however, that \"drugs\" and \"substances\" in <a href=\"/doc/127314/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 2(g)</a> of the Act have to be mutually exclusive, the definition of \"narcotic\" in <a href=\"/doc/127314/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 2(h)</a> makes it abundantly clear that a \"narcotic\" is a \"substance\", if not a \"drug\". Reliance on the decision of the Supreme Court in A.I.R. 1963 S.C. 665 cannot, thus, be of any avail to the Appellant.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_34\">16. Even so, ths question remains if the consignment in question was a \"medicinal preparation\" containing narcotic.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_35\">17. While it is true that taxing provisions are to be strictly construed (A.I.R 1971 S.C. 378) it does not appear that there is any warrant to construe item I(iii) of the Schedule in the manner sought for. Once it is held that the imported consignment was a \"medicinal preparation\", the fact that it was the narcotic itself and not a preparation containing narcotic would hardly appear to matter. Where a \"narcotic drug\" or \"narcotic\" by itself qualifies to be a \"medicinal preparation\" in terms of <a href=\"/doc/127314/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 2(g)</a> of the Act, it is difficult to exclude it from the ambit of Item I(iii) of the Schedule while including a \"medicinal preparation\" containing a narcotic, howsoever small in content.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_36\">18. The ordinary dictionary meaning of the word \"contain\" is \"comprise\" apart from \"include\" [Chamber's Twentieth Century Dictionary]. A \"medicinal preparation\" containing narcotic drug or narcotic can thus be one comprising, may be wholly, of a narcotic drug or narcotic. Thus understood, the absurdity that may arise if Item I(iii) of the Schedule can be applicable to a medicinal preparation with a trace of narcotic however small, and not to another comprising wholly of the narcotic itself, is avoided.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_37\">19. In the result, the appeal cannot sustain and is hereby dismissed.\n</p>\n\n \n\n",

This is a plaintiffs' appeal arising out of a suit for ejectment and arrears of rent. The plaintiffs claimed a sum of Rs. 2924.00 on account of rent and damages in respect of the accommodation in dispute and they further prayed for the ejectment of the defendant on the ground that he had defaulted in the payment of the rent and did not pay the arrears even after the notice of demand dated 1-1-66. This notice was followed by a notice under Section 106 of the T. P. Act dated 26-2-1966. Both the notices were given by all the four plaintiffs appellants. The trial court decreed the suit in its entirety. The lower appellate Court has dismissed the claim for ejectment but decreed the recovery of arrears. \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_3\"> 2. The facts leading up to the present appeal are as follows: \n</p><p id=\"p_4\">  One Triloki Nath was the owner of the accommodation in dispute. He sold it in favour of one Mahabir Pra-sad. Mahabir Prasad by a deed of sale dated 16-6-1961 transferred the property to Smt. Prabha, Km. Veena, Km. Reshmi and Km. Nirja. Km. Veena, Km. Reshmi and Km. Nirja are the daughters of Smt. Prabha and were minors on the date of the sale. By a sale deed dated 1-11-1965 Smt. Prabha and her three daughters sold the property to the plaintiffs. The deed was executed by Smt. Prabha and one Dr. Bhagwat Dutt, the father of Smt. Prabha, and the maternal grandfather of the three minor daughters of Smt Prabha as their de facto guardian. On 16-12-68 the three minors having attained majority ratified the sale deed dated 1-11-1965 and executed a deed of ratification in favour of the plaintiffs. On the basis of these two deeds the plaintiffs claimed to be the owners of the property in dispute. The plaintiffs however shortly after the sale deed dated 1-11-1965 issued the notice of demand against the defendant for the payment of rent. The defendant had been occupying the premises it appears, since 1961, and had been paying rent to the successive owners by cheque. The notice of demand was served on the defendant on 3-1-1966. By a registered letter dated 29-1-1966 the defendant sent a reply to the plaintiffs enclosing a cheque for the rent demanded in full satisfaction of the dues. In this letter the defendant clearly admitted the plaintiffs as his landlords and stated that the cheque was being sent in compliance to the demand for arrears of rent and in full satisfaction thereof. This letter however was not delivered to the plaintiffs It was alleged by the plaintiffs that this was due to the negligence of the postman who endorsed on the envelop that the letter could not be delivered being addressed in the names of four persons. The rent having thus not been received by the plaintiffs within the prescribed time they issued the notice dated 16-2-1966 under Section 106 of the T. P. Act terminating the defendants tenancy and requiring him to hand over possession of the premises. This notice was served on 3-3-1966. The defendant having failed to vacate the premises the suit giving rise to this appeal was filed, for ejectment and arrears of rent and damages. \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_5\"> 3. The defence delivered was that the defendant had sent the rent through cheque within the time prescribed by the notice dated 1-1-1966. The cheque was enclosed with a letter under registered cover addressed in the name of the four plaintiffs. In the letter it was stated that since all the four plaintiffs were the landlords and the rent was demanded by all of them a cheque drawn in favour of all, was being sent. It was thus pleaded that the defendant had not defaulted in the payment of rent and had sent the same within the prescribed period. The suit on the basis of default therefore could not be maintained. It was further pleaded that the notice to quit was defective, in that the original sale deed dated 1-11-1965 executed by Smt. Prabha and Sri Bhagwat Dutt on behalf of the three minor daughters of Smt. Prabha could not pass a valid title to the entire property, the transfer by a de facto guardian of a minor being invalid in law. The sale deed to the extent of the interest of the minors was thus void. The deed of ratification could also not validate the transaction the same being ab initio void. The plaintiffs consequently were owners of the property to the extent of one-fourth share only and they thus could not terminate the defendant's tenancy from the entire premises. The notice to quit the entire premises was thus invalid, since the case has been argued with reference only to these two points it is unnecessary to refer to the other pleas raised. \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_6\"> 4. The trial Court held that the remittance of the rent by cheque was no payment in the eyes of law. The defendant consequently was in default of payment of rent and liable to ejectment on that ground. It further held that the notice to quit was valid. The suit was accordingly decreed for ejectment as also for the arrears claimed. \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_7\"> 5. On appeal the lower appellate court allowed the appeal in part, dismissing the claim for ejectment while affirming the decree for the recovery of arrears on the findings that the remittance of rent by cheque was no payment in the eyes of law and since it never reached the plaintiffs the defendant was a defaulter. The defendant consequently was held in default of the payment of rent. \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_8\"> 6. The claim for ejectment was however dismissed on the ground that the sale deed dated 1-11-1966 being void in so far as it concerned the three minor girls, the deed of ratification dated 16-12-1968 could not have the effect of validating the same. The plaintiffs consequently were owners of only one-fourth of the property and could not terminate the defendant's tenancy from the entire premises. The notice to quit was thus held invalid, and the relief of ejectment refused on that ground. The claim for arrears was decreed on the finding that the landlords never received the rent and were entitled to recover the same from the defendant. \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_9\"> 7. The plaintiffs have filed this appeal against the decree refusing ejectment while the defendant has filed a cross-objection against the decree directing recovery of arrears. \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_10\"> 8. As regards the plaintiffs title to the property it seems to me that the defendant had by his letter dated 29-1-1966 clearly admitted the plaintiffs as his landlords in respect of the entire premises. Even if there was some defect in the original deed of sale dated 1-11-1966 the defendant has attorned to the plaintiffs in unequivocal terms by his letter dated 29-1-1966. He sent the entire arrears claimed and said that it was in satisfaction of the dues. In view of the recitals in the letter dated 29-1-1966 I am clearly of the opinion that the defendant is now estopped from challenging the title of the plaintiffs in respect of the premises. It is unnecessary in the circumstances to decide the question of the validity of the sale deed dated 1-11-1965 and the effect of the ratification made on 16-12-1968. \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_11\"> 9. The only question surviving for decision is whether the remittance of the rent by cheque with the covering letter dated 29-1-1966 constituted a valid tender in the eyes of law. Triloki Nath, father of the plaintiffs appellants was the original owner of the permises in dispute. It has come in the statement of the plaintiff Dharmendra Nath that he used to accept rent by cheques. The court below has disbelieved him as regards his statement that after the purchase of the property the plaintiffs stopped the defendant from paying rent by cheques. Payment by cheque was thus an acceptable mode of payment of rent and the plaintiffs had not forbidden the defendant from continuing that mode. It may be observed here that on the transfer of the property by Triloki Nath to Mahabir Pra-sad, Triloki Nath was appointed a Theka-dar for collection of rent. He continued to receive the rent by cheque. After the sale of the premises by Mahabir Prasad to Smt. Prabha and her three daughters it is again accepted that Triloki Nath continued as a Thekedar and realised the rent on their 'behalf. It is further established that Triloki Nath received' rent through cheques even during this period. Exh. A-2 is a list of counter-foils filed by the defendant to prove payment of rent by cheques to the landlords. It shows a payment of Rs. 2,130,00 by cheque dated 24-8-1964 to Triloki Nath. This refers to the period when Mahabir was owner of the property. Another counter-foil of a cheque in favour of Triloki Nath is for a sum of Rs. 1,732.50 and this refers to the period when Smt. Prabha and her three daughters were the owners. The defendant has further produced his Cash Book which is Exh,. A-10 to show that cheque was an accepted mode of payment of rent. It is true that after the property had been purchased by the present plaintiffs no tender of rent was made by cheque prior to 29-1-1966. The property was purchased by the plaintiffs on 1-11-1965. The demand for rent was made shortly thereafter by the notice dated 1-1-1966. Compliance to the demand was made by sending a cheque for Rs. 1,102.50 in the name of the four plaintiffs under a registered cover. The registered letter was however returned with an endorsement that it could not be delivered being in the name of four persons. Learned counsel for the respondent has produced Post and Telegraph Manual Vol. V, First Edition which contains Rule 117 to the following effect: \n</p><p id=\"p_12\">  \"Letters addressed to more than one person should be forwarded to destination. They may be delivered to any one of the persons whose names they bear, but should ordinarily be offered to them in the order in which the names appear on the cover. In the case of a registered letter, the receipt should be drawn out in the names of the addressees.\" \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_13\"> Learned counsel has informed me that this rule has not undergone any change so far. No contrary rule has been cited on behalf of the appellants, A registered letter addressed in the name of more than one person, should according to this rule be delivered to the addressee. The letter in the circumstances was wrongly returned. Whether it was at the instance of the plaintiffs appellants or on behalf of the post office the defendant was not to suffer on that account. The cheque in the circumstances was a normal postal remittance, which ought to have reached the addressee in due course. The question is whether it was a valid tender. \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_14\"> 10. Section 3 of the U. P. Temporary Control of Rent and <a href=\"/doc/463150/\" id=\"a_1\">Eviction Act</a> (hereinafter referred to as the Act) does not prescribe any particular mode of payment of rent. <a href=\"/doc/1750327/\" id=\"a_2\">See Jagannath Prasad v. Smt. Chandrawati</a>, 1969 All LJ 881 = (AIR 1970 All 309) (PB). Any mode of\n\npayment permissible under law would thus be a valid mode for the purposes of <a href=\"/doc/460193/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 3</a> of the Act. That provision is intended to give a protection to the tenant to save his tenancy ,by tendering the arrears of rent within a month of the notice of demand. The provision has to be construed in a manner to advance the intention of the legislature and not to penalise the tenant. <a href=\"/doc/271386/\" id=\"a_4\">See Bhikha Lal v. Munna Lal</a>, 1973 All LJ 236= (AIR 1973 All 128). A tenant is thus saved from ejectment if he remits rent in a manner permissible under law within a reasonable period of the notice of demand. He would not be liable to ejectment if it does not reach in time or has been returned to him. Sec. 3 is attracted only when a tenant is in default and not when the rent is in arrears. There is a clear distinction between a tenant being in arrears (of rent and being in arrears.) See Mst Indrasani v. Din Ali (1968 All WR (HC) 167) (FB). Thus if the defendant had bona fide remitted the rent by cheque and had believed that in the normal course it would reach the landlord he had discharged his part so for as <a href=\"/doc/460193/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 3</a> was concerned. <a href=\"/doc/271386/\" id=\"a_6\">Bhikha Lal v. Munna Lal</a>, 1974 All LJ 470 = (AIR 1974 AH 366) (FB) it was held that where a tenant sends rent through money order within the time prescribed by the notice of demand, he would not be liable to ejectment even though the money order reaches the payee beyond the prescribed period. It was further held that the post office is an agent of the payee and in certain circumstances of both the payee and the remitter. In Mrs. Indrasani v. Din Ali (supra) it w,as held that a remittance once refused by the landlord did not oblige the tenant to send it afresh, and he could not be treated as in arrears for eviction for the period for which the remittance had been made. The Full Bench in this connection observed that there was a distinction between a tenant being in arrears of rent and the rent being in arrears. The observation was as follows: \n</p><p id=\"p_15\">  \"There is a clear distinction between a case in which a tenant is in arrears of rent and a case in which the rent is in arrears.\" \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_16\"> The defendant in this case sent the cheque for a sum of Rs. 1,102.50 in full satisfaction of the demand under a bona fide belief that remittance by cheque being one of the accepted modes of payment, the same would be acceptable to the plaintiffs in discharge of the liability. Particularly when the landlords were no other than the sons of Triloki Nath who had been accepting rent through cheques. The demand was made by a registered letter. The cheque consequently was also sent  by registered post. \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_17\"> 11. In Parasram v. Damadi Lal (1971 Ren CJ 117) (Madh. Pra.) it was held that in a developed society payment by cheque has become a more convenient mode of discharging one's obligation. In that case the arrears of rent were sent by cheque and the same was held a valid tender, R. J. Bhave, J. observed \"It is no doubt true that issuance of a cheque does not operate as discharge of the obligation unless it is encashed, and it is treated as a conditional payment. Yet, in my view, this is a sufficient tender of arrears if the cheque is not dishonoured. In the present day society I am of the view, implied agreement should be inferred that if the payment is made by a cheque that payment of cheque would be accepted\". <a href=\"/doc/641256/\" id=\"a_7\">In Commr. of Income-tax Bombay South, Bombay v.  Ogale Glass Works Ltd., Ogale Wadi</a> (AIR 1954 SC 429 at p. 432) it was observed : \n</p><p id=\"p_18\">  \"That a sum of money may be received in more ways than one cannot be doubted. It may be received by the transfer of coins or currency notes or a negotiable instrument which represents and produces cash and is treated as such by businessmen.\" \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_19\"> Payment by cheque was thus held a valid mode of discharging one's liability. Sending the same through post was considered a normal mode of remittance. \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_20\"> 12. <a href=\"/doc/271386/\" id=\"a_8\">In Bhikha Lal v. Munna Lal</a> (supra) this Court held that there was no material difference or distinction between a payment by cheque and one made by money order. That was a case where payment was made by money order and the Full Bench on the strength of the authorities relating to payment by cheque came to the conclusion that a money order and a cheque stood at par so far as the discharge of a tenant's liability as regards the payment of rent was concerned. Learned counsel for the appellant urged that payment by cheque was a valid discharge only if there existed an agreement between the parties or there was a usage or custom to that effect. In the instant case it has already been seen that payment by cheque was a usual mode of payment between the defendant and the earlier landlords of the premises. This mode was an accepted mode, so far as those landlords were concerned. In Bhag-wan Devi Goel v. Shushila Rani (1961 All LJ 155) it was held that payment by cheque to constitute a valid tender, depended upon the custom of the locality and the previous practice between the parties. So far as the present plaintiffs are concerned the question of practice did not arise as the demand was made immediately after they became owners of the premises. This practice, however, had been clearly established as between the defendant and the earlier landlords. <a href=\"/doc/641256/\" id=\"a_9\">In Commr. of Income-tax, Bombay v.  Ogale\n\nGlass Works Ltd</a>. (supra) it was observed that the course of business, usage in general and the surrounding circumstances of a particular case determine the intention of the parties   as    regards    discharge    of liabilities .by ;payment by cheque. To the same effect are the observations    in    the Full     Bench     case   of   <a href=\"/doc/271386/\" id=\"a_10\">Bhikha   Lal   v. Munna   Lal</a>    (1974   All   LJ   470) = (AIR 1974   All   366).     It     has   already   been seen that the plaintiffs had been disbelieved when they stated that they had forbidden the defendant from sending    cheques towards payment  of rent.      The    plaintiffs had not restrained the defendant from doing so. The prevalent practice was to send it that way and the defendant could bona fide adhere to it until specifically forbidden to do so. The payment was thus bona fide made. It has to be noticed that on the return of the registered letter dated 29-1-1966 the defendant    again    sent    another cheque for the same amount    of    Rupees 1,102.50 np. to the plaintiff appellants on 12-2-1966. The registered    letter    accompanying this remittance stated that since the \"earlier letter had   been   returned   a cheque was being sent again so    that   no    liabilities may remain   outstanding.    The cheque along with the letter was received by the landlords but they   returned   the same on the ground that the tender was made beyond time. It is significant to note that in their letter dated    26-2-1966    returning the cheque the plaintiffs   did   not take any exception the tender being made by cheque or the cheque being drawn in favour of four persons. The only ground taken was that they had received it   late. It can therefore be assumed    that    there w,as no objection to the tender being made by cheque. This fact further receives support from the allegations   in   the   plaint, where the defendant was    categorised   a defaulter only on the ground of the cheque being sent -beyond time.   The   plaint again does not take any exception to   the payment of rent by cheque.    The    defendant in the circumstances was fully justified in remitting the rent  by cheque   and until that mode was specifically forbidden the cheque was ,a valid    tender   towards payment of rent. Learned counsel for the appellant invited my attention to  <a href=\"/doc/1541960/\" id=\"a_11\">Mohan-lal v.  Kanwar  Sen</a>  (AIR  1954 All 480).  In that case it was held that payment of rent by Bank draft was not a valid discharge of the liability unless there was an    express or implied agreement to that effect between the parties. The facts of that case are clearly distinguishable. Payment    by bank draft was not a prevalent practice in that case, nor was there   any   agreement alleged to that effect. The plaintiff had on an earlier occasion clearly forbidden   the defendant from sending a Bank Draft towards payment of rent and had  directed him to send the same by   money   order. \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_21\"> After this specific direction it was not open to the defendant to send the rent by Bank Draft. In these circumstances the Bench took the view that remittance of rent by a Bank Draft was neither a valid tender nor a valid payment. \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_22\"> 13. In the instant case, the plaintiffs had never forbidden the defendant from making payment by cheque. Mohan Lal's case thus does not help the plaintiffs, the remittance by cheque, in the circumstances, was a valid tender. The post office was an agent of the payee. The rent was sent on 29-1-1966 in the first instance, well within time. If the landlords did not accept or receive the same, the defendant was not to be penalised for it. He remitted the amount again by another cheque on 11-2-1966. His bona fides are clearly established. He could not be treated as a defaulter and ejected on that ground. The decree of the lower appellate court refusing ejectment has to be affirmed though on a different ground. \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_23\"> 14. The cross-objection challenges the recovery of rent of the entire premises by the plaintiffs. According to the defendant they were entitled to a part of the rent only as the sale deed in their favour in respect of the interest of the minors, was invalid. \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_24\"> 15. It has already been found that the defendant had accepted the plaintiffs as landlords of the entire premises v:de his letter dated 29-1-1966. The plaintiffs were accordingly entitled to recover the rent of the entire premises. The cross-objection thus has no force and is liable to be dismissed. \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_25\"> 16. In the result the appeal and the cross-objection fail and are dismissed. But in the circumstances of the case I make no order as to costs. \n</p>\n \n\n",

December, 1992 on daily wage basis and continued to work till\n\n26.8.2000. The workman claims to have worked for 240 days in a year\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\"> C.W.P. No.17851 of 2007                                                -2-</span>\n\n\npreceding the date of termination. It is alleged that his services have been\n\nterminated on 27.8.2000 without complying with the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1056316/\" id=\"a_1\">Section\n\n25-F</a> of Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (for short 'the Act') and also the\n\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/41851/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 25-G</a> of the Act has been violated, as the Management\n\nhas retained persons junior to the petitioner.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">          The stand of the Management was that the workman was engaged\n\nto carry out plantation work which is of seasonal nature. It was denied that\n\nthe workman has worked for 240 days in a calendar year.\n\n</p><p id=\"p_11\">          The learned Labour Court answered reference in favour of the\n\nworkman by raising adverse inference against the Management for not\n\nproducing the record of the engagement of the workman. It was found that\n\nthough the Management witness Dalip Singh, Range Forest Officer, MW-1,\n\nhas stated in the cross-examination that he has seen the original muster rolls\n\nfrom July, 1993 to August, 2000 before appearing as a witness. But, still he\n\nhas not produced the records. The learned Labour Court has returned a\n\nfinding that the workman has worked for more than 240 days preceding one\n\nyear from the date of termination.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_12\">          Learned counsel for the petitioner has relied placed upon a\n\ndecision of the Supreme Court in cases reported as Ghaziabad\n\nDevelopment Authority &amp; another Vs. Ashok Kumar &amp; another, 2008\n\n(4) SCC 261, <a href=\"/doc/932266/\" id=\"a_3\">Mahboob Deepak vs. Nagar Panchayat, Gajraula</a>,\n\n(2008) 1 SCC 575, M.P. Administration Vs.

It is contended that the respondent-workman\n\nwas engaged on daily wages without following the rules and principles of\n\nArticles 14 and 16 of the Constitution, therefore, even if the workman has\n\ncompleted 240 days of service, the said workman is not entitled to be\n\nreinstated and also for the grant of back wages. In M.P. Administration's\n\ncase (supra), the Court held to the following effect:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">          6.    \"The question, however, which arises for consideration is as\n          to whether in a situation of this nature, the learned Single Judge\n          and consequently the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court\n          should have directed reinstatement of the respondent with full\n          back wages. Whereas at one point of time, such a relief used to be\n          automatically granted, but keeping in view several other factors\n          and in particular the doctrine of public employment and\n          involvement of the public money, a change in the said trend is\n          now found in the recent decisions of this Court. This Court in a\n          large number of decisions in the matter of grant of relief of the\n          kind distinguished between a daily wager who does not hold a\n          post and a permanent employee. It may be that the definition of\n          \"workman\" as contained in <a href=\"/doc/1418464/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 2(s)</a> of the Act is wide and\n          takes within its embrace all categories of workmen specified\n          therein, but the same would not mean that even for the purpose of\n          grant of relief in an industrial dispute referred for adjudication,\n          application of constitutional scheme of equality adumbrated under\n          Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India, in the light of a\n          decision of a Constitution Bench of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/179794777/\" id=\"a_5\">Secy., State of\n          Karnataka v. Umadevi</a> and other relevant factors pointed out by\n          the Court in a catena of decisions shall not be taken into\n          consideration.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">          7.

It was held that\n\nthe Industrial Court exercises its discretionary jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1968818/\" id=\"a_6\">Section\n\n11A</a> of the Act, when it directs the amount of compensation to be paid to the\n\nworkman.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_15\">           In    Mahboob Deepak's case (supra), the Court held to the\n\nfollowing effect:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">           9.     \"Due to some exigency of work, although recruitment on\n           daily wages or on an ad hoc basis was permissible, but by reason\n           thereof an employee cannot claim any right to be permanently\n           absorbed in service or made permanent in absence of any statute\n           or statutory rules. Merely because an employee has completed\n           240 days of work in a year preceding the date of retrenchment, the\n           same would not mean that his services were liable to be\n           regularised.\"</blockquote><p id=\"p_16\">\n\n</p><p id=\"p_17\">           In Ghaziabad Development Authority's case (supra), the dispute\n\nreferred to the Labour Court was regarding termination of daily wagers\n\nappointed on ad hoc basis. It was held to the following effect:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">           19.       \"A statutory authority is obligated to make recruitments\n           only upon compliance with the equality clause contained in\n           Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. Any appointment\n           in violation of the said contitutional scheme as also the statutory\n           recruitment rules, if any, would be void.        These facts were\n           required to the kept in mind by the Labour Court before passing\n           an award of reinstatement.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">           20.       Furthermore, public interest would not be subserved if\n           after such a long lapse of time, the first respondent is directed to\n           be reinstated in service.\"</blockquote><p id=\"p_18\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\"> C.W.P.

This is a Stay Application filed with reference to the Order-in-Appeal of Collector of Central Excise (Appeals) dated 30-11-1993.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_3\">2. The Learned Counsel stated that in this case, the entire consignment was sold by the importer to the appellant on High Sea Sale basis and endorsements to this effect was made on all copies of Bills of Entry. The entire consignment was brought from the Customs House directly to their factory in original packed condition and the modvat credit was taken accordingly.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_4\">3. The modvat is however sought to be denied on the ground that this was not permissible.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_5\">4. It was their submission that this is a well recognised practice and was permissible under the rules. And in this connection, they would draw attention to the Bombay Collectorate Trade Notice No. 57/1987 dated 7-8-1987.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_6\">5. Learned Departmental Representative stated that in view of a series of orders of this Tribunal on this point he does not oppose the request for waiver of pre-deposit and has no objection if Appeal itself is heard and disposed of.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_7\">6. Learned Counsel also states that as this is the only point involved he has also no objection if the appeal itself is heard and disposed of.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_8\">7. We observe that the assessed Bill of Entry is a document which constitutes proof of payment of duty in respect of the goods mentioned therein; and it is well settled that modvat credit can be availed of on the basis of such documents, particularly in the case of sale on High Sea Sales basis provided that the Bills of Entry are duly endorsed in favour of the purchaser; (and the required certificate /declaration are noted thereon). We therefore, waive the pre-deposit of the amount in question.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_9\">8. Further we take the main appeal itself with the consent of both the sides.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_10\">9. Since it is already well settled, by a catena of orders of this Tribunal, that modvat can be availed of in the circumstances, noted above, we set aside the impugned orders and accept the appeal.\n</p>\n \n\n",

Srivastava, Accountant Member\n \n\n</p><p id=\"p_2\">1. The department has filed the present appeal on the following grounds:\n</p>  \n\n<p id=\"p_3\">1. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the learned Commissioner (Appeals) has erred in directing to allow deduction of Rs. 1,94,96,945 on account of the provisions for accrued expenses which was correctly disallowed by the assessing officer.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_4\">2. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the learned Commissioner (Appeals) has erred in directing to allow exemption under Section 10(33) in respect of whole dividend income of Rs, 4,85,24,362 instead of the net income rightly determined by the assessing officer at Rs. 1, 17,21,951\n \n\n</p><p id=\"p_5\">2. Briefly stated, the facts of the case are that the assessee- company was engaged in the business of providing financial services like commercial vehicle financing, equipment finance, advances against financial assets and inter-corporate loans and deposits. During the course of the assessment proceedings, the assessing officer noticed that the assessee had earned dividend of Rs. 4,85,24,362 which was exempt from tax. Taking note of <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 14A</a> of the Income Tax Act, he called upon the assessee to furnish the details of expenditure incurred in earning the aforesaid dividend and also to explain as to why expenditure on pro rata basis should not be apportioned to the earning of the aforesaid dividend. In reply, the assessee submitted before the assessing officer that it had not incurred any expenditure in earning the aforesaid dividend and hence the pro rata basis could not be applied to allocate the expenditure for earning the said dividend. In the absence of details, the assessing officer applied pro rata basis for allocating the total expenditure of Rs. 90,64,63,336 between exempt income (i.e., dividend) and non-exempt income in the ratio of their receipts (total receipts being 119,48,19,592 including dividend receipts of Rs. 4,85,24,362). In this manner, he quantified the expenditure at Rs. 3,68,02,411 being 4.06 per cent of total expenditure as having been incurred in relation to earning the(dividend and therefore disallowed the same while computing non-exempt income. On appeal, the learned Commissioner (Appeals), by his order dated 16-6-2003, directed the assessing officer to allow deduction on the gross amount of dividend without allocating any expenditure. department is aggrieved by the aforesaid order and is now in appeal before this Tribunal.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_6\">3. In support of appeal, the learned departmental Representative relied upon the grounds of appeal, the assessment order and the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 14A</a> and submitted that the impugned disallowance was in conformity with the aforesaid provisions.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_7\">4. In reply, the learned Counsel for the assessee submitted that gross dividend amounting to Rs. 4,85,24,362 was received from nine companies which was exempt from tax. According to him, dividend income was reflected in the accounts under the head \"Permanent investments\". It was also submitted that all deployment of funds in permanent investments were made out of capital infusion into the assessee- company from Citicorp Overseas Investment Corporation and that all outside borrowings were made for meeting the requirements of working capital of the assessee-company and not for making the permanent investments. It was vehemently contended that since all the investments on which dividend was earned were entirely made out of own funds and, in this view of the matter, no interest expenditure incurred by the assessee was allocable to the earning of dividend income.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_8\">5. He invited our attention to the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 14A</a> and submitted that rule of proportionality of expenditure was not applicable for making the disallowance under <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 14A</a>.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_9\">6. He further submitted that the issue under consideration had since been decided by this Tribunal in favour of the assessee by order dated 7-10-2005 in the department's appeal in the assessee's own case for assessment year 1998-99. In this connection, he invited our attention to para II of the said order, which reads as under:\n</p><p id=\"p_10\"> We have heard both the parties. The Delhi Tribunal, in the case of Maruti Udyog Ltd., cited supra, has held that no disallowance could be made under <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 14A</a> where the assessee has interest-free funds far and excess of amounts invested in shares of other companies. The assessee-company was having capital far and excess of the investment made on which the dividend income was received. Moreover, it has been held by the various courts that proportionate disallowance of expenses is not permissible. The findings of the learned Commissioner (Appeals) are upheld and the third ground is dismissed.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_11\">7. He also invited our attention to another order dated 19-1-2006 passed by this Tribunal in the department's appeal in the assessee's case for assessment year 1999-2000 in which the earlier order of the Tribunal for assessment year 1998-99 has been followed.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_12\">8. We have heard both the parties and considered their submissions including the judicial authorities cited by them. Short issue in the matter before us is whether the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 14A</a> empower the assessing officer to make proportionate allocation in respect of the expenditure incurred in relation to exempt income and consequentially take the same into account for computing the exempt income and, if so, whether the mechanism for computing allocation of such expenditure as provided in Sub-section (2)/(3) of <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 14A</a> (inserted by the <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_8\">Finance Act</a>, 2006) would apply to all pending matters or would apply to matters arising with effect from assessment year 2006-07.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_13\">9. <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 14A</a> has been inserted in the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_10\">Income Tax Act</a>, <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 11</a> of the Finance Act, 2001, with retrospective effect from 1-4-1962, i.e., for and from assessment year 1962-63. <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 14A</a> has been amended by <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 10</a> of the Finance Act, 2002 and again by <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 7</a> of the Finance Act, 2006. <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 14A</a> as so amended reads now as under:\n</p>  \n\n<p id=\"p_14\">14A. Expenditure incurred in relation to income not includible in total Income.-(I) For the purposes of computing the total income under this Chapter, no deduction shall be allowed in respect of expenditure incurred by the assessee in relation to income which does not form part of the total income under this Act.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_15\">(2) The assessing officer shall determine the amount of expenditure incurred in relation to such income which does not form part of the total income under this Act in accordance with such method as may be prescribed, if the assessing officer, having regard to the accounts of the assessee, is not satisfied with the correctness of the claim of the assessee in respect of such expenditure in relation to income which does not form part of the total income under this Act.-\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_16\">(3) The provisions of Sub-section (2) shall also apply in relation to a case where an assessee claims that no expenditure has been incurred by him in relation to income which does not form part of the total income under this Act:\n</p><p id=\"p_17\"> Provided that nothing contained in this section shall empower the assessing officer either to reassess under <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 147</a> or pass an order enhancing the assessment or reducing a refund already made or otherwise increasing the liability of the assessee under <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 154</a>, for any assessment year beginning on or before the Ist day of April, 2001.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_18\">(*Inserted as <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 14A</a> (without numbering) in the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_19\">Income Tax Act</a> by the <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_20\">Finance Act</a>, 2001 with retrospective effect from 1-4-1962.** Inserted by the <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_21\">Finance Act</a>, 2006 and consequently all the clauses of <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 14A</a> were numbered. -Inserted by the <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_23\">Finance Act</a>, 2002.)\n \n\n</p><p id=\"p_19\">10. In the matter before us, we are not concerned with the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 14A</a>. We are concerned with Sub-section (1) (as originally inserted (without numbering of the sub-section) by the <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_25\">Finance Act</a>, 2001 with retrospective effect from 1-4-1962) and Sub-section (2)/(3) (inserted by the <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_26\">Finance Act</a>, 2006 with consequential numbering of the clauses of <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 14A</a>) of <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 14A</a>. The scope and effect of the insertion of <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 14A</a>, with retrospective effect from 1-4-1962, in the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_30\">Income Tax Act</a> by the <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_31\">Finance Act</a>, 2001 have been explained in para 25 of Circular No. 14 of 2001 issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes, which reads as under:\n</p>  \n\n<p id=\"p_20\">25. No deduction for expenditure incurred in respect of exempt income against taxable income.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_21\">25.1 Certain incomes are not includible while computing the total income, as these are exempt under various provisions of the Act. There have been cases where deductions have been claimed in respect of such exempt income. This in effect means that the tax incentive given by way of exemptions to certain categories of income, is being used to reduce also the tax payable on the non-exempt income by debiting the expenses incurred to earn the exempt income against taxable income. This is against the basic principles of taxation whereby only the net income, i.e., gross income minus the expenditure, is taxed. On the same analogy, the exemption is also in respect of the net income. Expenses incurred can be allowed only to the extent they are relatable to the earning of taxable income.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_22\">25.2 <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_32\">Through Finance Act</a>, 2001, a new <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 14A</a> has been inserted so as to clarify the intention of the Legislature since the inception of the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_34\">Income Tax Act</a>, 1961, that no deduction shall be made in respect of any expenditure incurred by the assessee in relation to income which does not form part of the total income under the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_35\">Income Tax Act</a>.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_23\">25.3 Vide Circular No. 11/2001, dated 23-7-2001, a direction was issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes that the assessments where the proceedings have become final before the first day of April, 2001 should not be re-opened under <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 147</a> of the Act to disallow expenditure relatable to the exempt income by applying the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 14A</a> of the Act. This circular has been issued by the Board by exercising its powers to issue beneficial circular under <a href=\"/doc/1739359/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 119(2)(a)</a> of the Income Tax Act.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_24\">25.4 This amendment takes effect retrospectively from 1-4-1962 and accordingly, applies in relation to the assessment year 1962-63 and subsequent assessment years.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_25\">11. <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 14A</a> clearly makes a distinction between exempt income and taxable income. It treats both of them as separate classes for computation of income after allocation of expenditure relating thereto and mandates that no deduction in respect of any expenditure shall  allowed against taxable income which is incurred in relation to exempt income. The underlying object is to compute both the exempt income and taxable income correctly, which is possible only after the expenditure incurred in relation thereto is allocated to them. In other words, <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 14A</a> bars the deduction of expenditure incurred in relation to exempt income out of taxable income, as this would have the effect of artificially inflating the exempt income and thereby deflating the taxable income.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_26\">12. The prohibition for allowing the deduction under <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 14A</a> for and from assessment year 1962-63 is \"in respect of expenditure incurred by the assessee in relation to income\" which does not form part of the total income. The term \"expenditure\" has been defined at page 598 of Black's Law Dictionary (Seventh Edition) thus: \" 1. The act or process of paying out; disbursement. 2. A sum paid out.\" The term \"expense\" has been defined at the same page of the aforesaid dictionary as follows: \"n. An expenditure of money, time, labour, or resources to accomplish a result; esp., a business expenditure chargeable against revenue for a specific period. - expense, vb. Cf. COST (1).\" The \"expense\" has many forms, namely, accrued expense, administrative expense, business expense, capital expense, capitalized expense, current expense, deferred expense, educational expense, entertainment expense, extraordinary expense, fixed expense, funeral expense, general administrative expense, medical expense, moving expense, operating expense, ordinary and necessary expense, organizational expense, put-of-pocket expense, prepaid expense, travel expense. The term \"expenditure\" occurring in <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 14A</a> would thus take in its sweep not only direct expenditure but also all forms of expenditure regardless of whether they are fixed, variable, direct, indirect, administrative, managerial or financial. The term \"incur\" has been defined at page 771 of the aforesaid dictionary as follows: \"incur, vb. To suffer or bring on oneself (a liability or expense).\" One of the meanings given to the word \"relate\" under the head \"Law\" at page 2534 in \" The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary\" (1993 Edition) is \"Have some connection with, be connected to.\" The phraseology used in <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 14A</a> prohibiting the deduction in respect of expenditure incurred by the assessee in relation to exempt income is thus wide enough to cover all forms of expenses provided they have some connection with the exempt income. This is based on the principle that expenses must be allocated to that income to which they are connected to avoid distortions in the computation of both taxable as well as exempt income. This is also achieved by the matching principle of accountancy. <a href=\"/doc/1283018/\" id=\"a_44\">In Taparia Tools Ltd. v. Jt. CIT</a> , the Hon'ble jurisdictional High Court has explained the matching principle as under:\n</p><p id=\"p_27\"> The mercantile system of accounting is based on accrual. Basically, it is a double entry system of accounting. Under the mercantile system of accounting, profits arising or accruing at the date of the transaction are liable to be taxed not withstanding the fact that they are not actually received. or deemed to be received under the Act. Under the mercantile system of accounting, therefore, book profits are liable to be taxed. The profits earned and credited in the books of account constitute the basis of computation of income. The system postulates the existence of tax in so far as monies due and payable by the parties to whom they are debited. Therefore, under the mercantile system of accounting, in order to determine the net income of an accounting year, the revenue and other incomes are matched with the cost of resources consumed (expenses). Under the mercantile system of accounting, this matching is required to be done on accrual basis. Under this matching concept, revenue and income earned during an accounting period, irrespective of actual cash in-flow, is required to be compared with expenses incurred during the same period, irrespective of actual out-flow of cash. In this case, the assessee is following the mercantile system of accounting. This matching concept is very relevant to compute taxable income....\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_28\">13. It is difficult to accept the hypothesis that one can earn substantial dividend income without incurring any expenses whatsoever including management or administrative expenses. By same logic, it is equally difficult to accept that the only expenses involved in earning the dividend income are those incurred on collection of dividend or on encashing a few dividend warrants. A company cannot earn dividend without its existence and management. Investment decisions are very complex in nature. They require substantial market research, day-to-day analysis of market trends and decisions with regard to acquisition, retention and sale of shares at the most appropriate time. They require huge investment in shares and consequential blocking of funds. It is well known that capital has cost and that element of cost is represented by interest. Besides, investment decisions are generally taken in the meetings of the Board of Directors for which administrative expenses are incurred. It is therefore not correct to say that dividend income can be earned by incurring no or nominal expenditure. This aspect of the matter has also received careful attention of Chennai Bench of this Tribunal in <a href=\"/doc/1116200/\" id=\"a_45\">Southern Petro Chemical Industries v. Dy. CIT</a> (2005) 3 SOT 157 (Chennai-Trib). After comprehensive consideration of all the relevant aspects of the case including the provisions of law, the Chennai Bench has held that investment decisions are very strategic decisions in which top management is involved and therefore proportionate management expenses are required to be deducted while computing the exempt income from dividend. <a href=\"/doc/10850/\" id=\"a_46\">In Harish Krishnakant Bhatt v. Income Tax Officer</a> (2004) 91 ITD 311 (Ahd.), the Ahmedabad Bench of this Tribunal has held that, the dividend income being exempt under <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 10(33)</a>, the interest on capital borrowed for acquisition of relevant shares yielding such dividend cannot be allowed deduction by operation of <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 14A</a>. <a href=\"/doc/135851/\" id=\"a_49\">In Dy. CIT v. SG Investments &amp; Industries Ltd</a>.  (2004) 89 ITD 44 (Cal.), the Calcutta Bench of this Tribunal has laid down two propositions: one, in view of <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 14A</a> inserted in the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_51\">Income Tax Act</a> with retrospective effect from 1-4-1962, pro rata expenses on account of interest relatable to investment in shares for earning exempt income from dividend are to be disallowed against taxable income and only the net dividend income is to be allowed exemption after deducting the expenses; and two, the expression \"expenditure incurred by the assessee in relation to income which does not form part of the total income\" in <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 14A</a> has to be given a wider meaning and would include both direct and indirect relationship between expenditure and exempt income. Following the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/604928/\" id=\"a_53\">CIT v. United General Trust Ltd</a>.  , the Calcutta Bench of the Tribunal has also held that the interest paid by the assessee being attributable to the money borrowed for the purpose of making the investment which yielded the dividend and other expenses incurred in connection with or for making or earning the dividend income can be regarded as expenditure incurred in relation to dividend income. <a href=\"/doc/102537/\" id=\"a_54\">In Everplus Securities &amp; Finance Ltd. v. Dy. CIT</a> (2006) 101 ITD 151 (Del), the Delhi Bench of this Tribunal has held that merely because the assessee did not earn the dividend out of investment in certain shares does not imply that the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 14A</a> would not apply to that extent. In Asstt. <a href=\"/doc/369778/\" id=\"a_56\">CIT v. Premier Consolidated Capital Trust (I</a>). Ltd. (2004) 83 TTJ (Mum.) 843, the Mumbai Bench of this Tribunal has held that the assessing officer is justified in attributing a part of the financial and administrative expenses as expenditure incurred in relation to exempt income and disallowing the same in view of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 14A</a>.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_29\">14. Keeping in view the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 14A</a> as also the aforesaid decisions of the co-ordinate Benches of this Tribunal, we hold that all expenses connected with the exempt income have to be disallowed under <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 14A</a> regardless of whether they are direct or indirect, fixed or variable and managerial or financial in accordance with law. In this connection, the provisions of Sub-section (2)/(3) of <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 14A</a> inserted by the <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_61\">Finance Act</a>, 2006 deserve to be noted.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_30\">15. The procedure for computation of disallowance has now been provided in Sub-sections (2) and (3) of <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 14A</a> of the Income Tax Act. It is no longer open to the assessing officer to apply his discretion in computing the disallowance or make ad hoc disallowance under <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 14A</a>. Substantive provisions are contained in Sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 14A</a> prohibiting deduction in respect of expenditure incurred in relation to exempt income while procedural provisions regarding computation of the aforesaid disallowance are contained in Sub-sections (2) and (3) thereof. Sub-sections (2) and (3) seek to achieve the underlying object of <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 14A(l)</a> that any expenditure incurred in relation to exempt income should not be allowed deduction. It is fairly well-settled by a catena of decisions that procedural provisions apply to all pending matters and that the rule against retrospectivity does not hit them.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_31\">16. In W.H. Cockerline and Co. v. IRC (1930) 16 TC I (CA) at 19, Lord Hanworth quoted with approval the following passage from the judgment of Sargant L. J.:\n</p><p id=\"p_32\"> The liability is imposed by the charging section, namely, <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 38</a>, the words of which are clear. The subsequent provisions as to assessment and so on are machinery only. They enable the liability to be quantified, and when quantified to be enforced against the subject, but the liability is definitely and finally created by the charging section and all the materials for ascertaining it are available immediately.\" In Halsbury's Law of England (Fourth edition, Vol. 23, paragraph 29), referring to the machinery provisions, it is stated: \"It is important to distinguish between charging provisions, which impose the charge to tax, and machinery provisions, which provide the machinery for the quantification of the charge and the levying and collection of the tax in respect of the charge so imposed. Machinery provisions do not impose a charge or extend or restrict a charge elsewhere clearly imposed.\" In Kesoram Industries &amp; Cotton Mills Ltd. v. CWT  Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shah observed: \"<a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 7(2)</a> merely provides machinery in certain special cases for valuation of assets, and it is from the aggregate valuation of assets that the net wealth chargeable to tax may be ascertained.... This is an artificial rule adopted with a view to avoid investigation of a mass of evidence which it would be difficult to secure or, if secured, may require prolonged investigation.\" Though the aforesaid observation was part of the minority opinion, there is, however, nothing said to the contra in the majority view. In Associated Cement Co. Ltd. v. CTO (1981) 48 STC 466 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held: \"It is settled law that a distinction has to be made by courts while interpreting the provisions of a taxing statute between charging provisions which impose the charge to tax and machinery provisions which provide the machinery for the quantification of the tax and the levying and collection of the tax so imposed. While charging provisions are construed strictly, machinery sections are not generally subject to a rigorous construction. The courts are expected to construe the machinery sections in such a manner that a charge to tax is not defeated.\" Bennions Statutory Interpretation (First edition, page 446, paragraph 191) lays down as follows: \"Because a change made by the legislator in procedural provisions is expected to be for the general benefit of litigants and others, it is presumed that it applies to pending as well as future proceedings.\" At page 447, it is stated: \"Procedure and practice is the mere machinery of law enforcement. As Ormrod L.J. said : 'The object of all procedural rules is to enable justice to be done between the parties consistently with the public interest'.\" <a href=\"/doc/37474/\" id=\"a_68\">In Jose Da Costa v. Bascora Sadashiva Sinai Narcornim</a> , the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held at page 1849 of AIR 1975 SC. \"Before ascertaining the effect of the enactments aforesaid passed by the Central Legislature on pending suits or appeals, it would be appropriate to bear in mind two well-established principles. The first is that 'while provisions of a statute dealing merely with matters of procedure may properly, unless that construction be textually inadmissible, have retrospective effect attributed to them, provisions which touch a right in existence at the passing of the statute are not to be applied retrospectively in the absence of express enactment or necessary intendment' (See Delhi Cloth and General Mills Co. Ltd. v. ITC AIR 1927 PC 242). The second is that a right of appeal being a substantive right the institution of a suit carries with it the implication that all successive appeals available under the law then in force would be preserved to the parties to the suit throughout the rest of the career of the suit. There are two exceptions to the application of this rule, viz., (i) when by competent enactment such right of appeal is taken away expressly or impliedly with retrospective effect; and (ii) when the court to which appeal lay at the commencement of the suit stands abolished (<a href=\"/doc/673500/\" id=\"a_69\">See Garikapatti Veeraya v. N. Subbiah Choudhury</a> , and Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Ltd v. Irving (1905) AC 369 (PC))\" Halsbury's Laws of England (Fourth edition, Vol. 44, paragraph 925) states : \"The presumption against retrospection does not apply to legislation concerned merely with matters of procedure or of evidence; on the contrary, provisions of that nature are to be construed as retrospective unless there is a clear indication that such was not the intention of Parliament.\" All the aforesaid observations have been cited, with approval, by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in CWT v. Sharvan KumarSwarup &amp; Sons .\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_33\">17. In view of the aforesaid, we hold that the provisions for quantification of disallowance as contained in Sub-sections (2) and (3) of <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 14A</a> are procedural and therefore apply to all pending matters. It is no longer open to the assessing officer to make disallowance according to his own discretion or on ad hoc basis. He is statutorily required to compute the disallowance in the manner provided by Sub-sections (2) and (3) of <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 14A</a>. We therefore set aside the orders passed by the Commissioner (Appeals) and the assessing officer in this behalf and restore the matter to the assessing officer for a fresh examination and decision in the light of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 14A</a> including Sub-sections (2) and (3) thereof, in accordance with law.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_34\">18. We are aware that the Rule' of Consistency requires us to follow the orders of the co-ordinate Benches of this Tribunal till there is a change in either the factual situation or the legal position. In the case before us, Sub-sections (2) and (3) of <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 14A</a> were not available on the statute book when the orders were passed by this Tribunal in the assessee's own case for earlier two years. We have already held above that the aforesaid provisions have retroactive operation and therefore would apply to all pending matters. They cannot therefore be ignored. Besides, other relevant decisions rendered by this Tribunal in the cases cited supra were also not brought to the notice of this Tribunal at the time when department's appeal for earlier two years in the assessee's own case were decided.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_35\">19. In view of the foregoing, the appeal filed by the department is treated as allowed for statistical purposes.\n</p> \n\n",

Ramachandran Nair, J.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_2\">1. The short question arising in these connected tax revision cases pertaining to two assessees is whether they are liable to pay purchase tax under Section 5A of the Kerala General Sales Tax Act, 1963, hereinafter called \"the Act\" on the purchase turnover of red oil which was converted by them in their factory to sandalwood oil and sold by them as such. The assessments pertain to the years 1989-90 to 1995-96. Since the main order of the Tribunal is produced in T.R.C. No. 419 of 2000 the facts referred to in the said T.R.C. are considered by us for our decision. In fact all the subsequent orders of the Tribunal are based on their order produced in T.R.C. No. 419 of 2000.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_3\">2. The assessees were admittedly engaged in massive purchase of red oil from unregistered dealers who have not collected or remitted any sales tax on their sales to the assessees. Red oil is manufactured out of sandalwood, source of which is only forest in Kerala and Karnataka. In fact the assessing officer rightly pointed out that layman from whom assessees claimed to have purchased red oil cannot produce and sell the same because red oil can be extracted from sandalwood through an elaborate process which could be done in a factory. It is a notorious fact that accounted sandalwood oil production has no relation to the quantity of sandalwood sold by the Forest Department and instances of theft of sandalwood from forest with the patronage of Government officials and production of oil from it in factories run clandestinely in Kerala were hitting the headlines of newspapers. Even though enquiry could have been conducted and assessees should have been made to disclose the identity of persons who supplied red oil to them, failing which the source of red oil could have been attributed to the very same assessees, the assessing officer even after doubting the genuineness of the transactions accepted the purchases and levied tax under Section 5A of the Act on the purchase turnover of red oil on the ground that the assessees have consumed red oil in the manufacture of their final product, namely, sandalwood oil. The case of the assessees is that the process of manufacture of sandalwood oil is only removal of impurities and water from red oil by heating it. However, it is admitted fact that assessees have established factories and used steam generated in boilers for heating the raw material, namely, red oil to make sandalwood oil. It is also conceded that assessees are registered under the <a href=\"/doc/110162683/\" id=\"a_1\">Central Excise Act</a> and are remitting excise duty on the manufactured product, namely, sandalwood oil. The main reason for the first appellate authority for holding that there is manufacture of product is the payment of excise duty by the assessees. The contention of the assessees before the Tribunal was that there was no chemical use in the manufacture and all what is achieved in the process engaged in the factory is removal of impurities and water from red oil. The assessees relied on several decisions including that of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/903306/\" id=\"a_2\">Tungabhadra Industries Ltd. v. Commercial Tax Officer</a> [1960] 11 STC 827. The Tribunal accepted the contentions of the assessees and held that there was no manufacture of a new product as the process involved did not involve use of any chemical and all what the assessees have done is removal of impurities and water from red oil.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_4\">3. We have heard Special Government Pleader appearing for the State-revision petitioner in all the cases, and Senior Counsel Sri. C. Natarajan, appearing for the assessees. While theSpecial Government Pleader contended that process done in the factory of the assessees amounts to manufacture of a new product, namely, sandalwood oil, from the raw material, that is, red oil and relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/2503/\" id=\"a_3\">Assistant Commissioner (Intelligence) v. Nandanam Construction Co</a>. [1999] 115 STC 427 and the Division Bench decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/3953/\" id=\"a_4\">State of Kerala v. Cochin Shipyard Limited</a> . Counsel for the assessees advanced the same contentions that were raised by them before the Tribunal.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_5\">4. So far as the controversy on manufacturing process, we do not think the contention of the assessees that the process involved is simple removal of water and impurities from the red oil is acceptable because if the process is so simple, we see no reason why a factory with equipments and boilers should be established for this process. The minimum process engaged as evident from the admitted facts is steam distillation of red oil to separate water and sandalwood oil as the raw material is a mix of both. No doubt red oil which is a crude product distilled from sandalwood is still a raw material used for the manufacture of sandalwood oil and it is not a product fit for any application. Therefore red oil, the raw material, and sandalwood oil, the final product, are commercially different. There is substantial value difference between the raw material and the final product which is evident from the purchase value accounted by the assessees for raw material and the value of the final product received by them on sale. Even though assessees contention that manufacture under the <a href=\"/doc/110162683/\" id=\"a_5\">Excise Act</a> is not the same as manufacture under <a href=\"/doc/26807273/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 5A</a> of the Act, which found acceptance with the Tribunal, we are unable to uphold the claim of the assessees upheld by the Tribunal, because assessees have not made any claim that excise duty is paid by them without any dispute by virtue of any special provision in the <a href=\"/doc/110162683/\" id=\"a_7\">Excise Act</a> providing for duty in respect of any other activity other than manufacturing in this case. Even though counsel for the assessees relied on large number of decisions of the Supreme Court and High Courts particularly in <a href=\"/doc/591045/\" id=\"a_8\">Alladi Venkateswarlu v.

State of Bombay</a> , we do not find any decision directly applicable to the facts of this case. In fact Supreme Court has, though in the context of the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_28\">Income-tax Act</a> in <a href=\"/doc/832312/\" id=\"a_29\">Aspinwall and Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax</a> case , held that just removal of husk/covering from coffee berry to separate coffee beans is a manufacturing activity. Apart from this decision, in large number of decisions, the Supreme Court has held that the process of making goods commercially different from raw material with distinct name, character and use, amounts to manufacture of a product. Moreover, the scope of purchase tax liability under Section 6A of the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act which is the same as Section 5A of the Kerala General Sales Tax Act, is explained by a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in the decision in <a href=\"/doc/2503/\" id=\"a_30\">Assistant Commissioner (Intelligence) v. Nandanam Construction Company</a> reported in [1999] 115 STC 427. In the said decision, the Supreme Court has held that once the goods purchased by the dealer are used in construction and cease to be available in that form for sale or purchase again to attract tax, the liability for purchase tax is attracted. This decision is followed by a Division Bench of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/3953/\" id=\"a_31\">State of Kerala v. Cochin Shipyard Limited</a>  wherein this Court upheld the levy of purchase tax on the purchase turnover of water by Cochin Shipyard Ltd., though water purchased was not consumed in the manufacture of any commodity. In fact it is to be noted that by the 1989 amendment <a href=\"/doc/26807273/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 5A</a> was amended to bring within the scope of purchase tax, items purchased from unregistered dealers without payment of tax for \"use\". <a href=\"/doc/26807273/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 5A</a> with it's amendment is extracted hereunder for easy reference:\n</p>  \n\n<p id=\"p_6\">5A. Levy of purchase tax.--(1) Every dealer who, in the course of his business, purchase from a registered dealer or from any other person any goods, the sale or purchase of which is liable to tax under this Act, in circumstances in which no tax is payable under Sub-sections (1), (3), (4) or (5) of <a href=\"/doc/115038149/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 5</a> and either,-\n</p>  \n\n<p id=\"p_7\">(a) consumes such goods in the manufacture of other goods for sale or otherwise; or\n \n\n</p><p id=\"p_8\">(b) uses or disposes of such goods in any manner other than by way of sale in the State; or\n \n\n</p><p id=\"p_9\">(c) despatches them to any place outside the State except as a direct result of sale or purchase in the course of inter-State trade or commerce; shall, whatever be the quantum of the turnover relating to such purchase for a year, pay tax on the taxable turnover relating to such purchase for the year at the rates mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/115038149/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 5</a>.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_10\">(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in Sub-section (1), a dealer (other than a casual trader or agent of a non-resident dealer) purchasing goods, the sale of which is liable to tax under <a href=\"/doc/115038149/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 5</a>, shall not be liable to pay tax under Sub-section (1) if his total turnover for a year is less than two lakh rupees.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_11\">5. From Clause (a) of <a href=\"/doc/42690087/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 5A(1)</a> above, it is clear that liability is attracted when goods purchased are consumed in the manufacture of other goods for sale. Since we have found above that assessees have purchased raw material, namely, red oil and have consumed the same in the manufacture of sandalwood oil sold by them as final product, liability is attracted on the purchase turnover of red oil under <a href=\"/doc/42690087/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 5A(1)(a)</a> of the Act. Assuming that assessees' contention that there is no consumption as such of red oil in the manufacture of sandalwood oil is correct, it is admitted that red oil which has not suffered tax has ceased to exist after the same is used up in the manufacture of sandalwood oil and therefore liability in any case is attracted under <a href=\"/doc/42690087/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 5A(1)(b)</a> of the Act, because use or disposal of the item purchased in any other manner other than by way of sale in the State also attracts liability. As held by the Supreme Court in the above decision, the object of the Section is to rope in liability when the item purchased has not been subjected to any tax until it's purchase and the item ceases to exist after it's use by purchasing dealer. Assessees case itself is that suppliers are unregistered dealers and red oil purchased by them has not suffered any tax and after red oil is used by them in the production of sandalwood oil, it ceases to exist. Therefore, if purchase tax is not levied at the hands of the assessees, the same will frustrate and defeat the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/26807273/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 5A</a> of the Act.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_12\">6. We do not know on what basis the Tribunal has assumed that in order to attract liability under <a href=\"/doc/26807273/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 5A</a> manufacture of a product should be done with the use of chemicals. We are constrained, to observe that the finding of the Tribunal is patently absurd and perverse.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_13\">7. We therefore allow the tax revision cases, reversing the orders of the Tribunal, upholding levy of tax under <a href=\"/doc/26807273/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 5A</a> of the Act on the purchase turnover of red oil by respondents-assessees for all the years.\n</p> \n\n",

The defendants, State of Punjab and others, having lost before the learned first Appellant Court have approached this Court through the present regular second appeal.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_3\">2. The facts which emerge from the record show that plaintiff-Budha Singh filed a suit for declaration to the effect that the Order dated November 23, 1993 passed by the Senior Superintendent of Police, Gurdaspur, defendant No. 2 vide which the plaintiff was retired from service prematurely was illegal and bad. He also challenged the order dated July 14, 1994 vide which the Director General of Police, Punjab rejected the subsequent request made by the plaintiff for withdrawal of his resignation/request for premature retirement.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_4\">3. The plaintiff pleaded that he was enlisted as a Constable with the Punjab Police with effect from March 14, 1972. In 1991, the son of the plaintiff was murdered by the terrorists. It was claimed by him that on account of the aforesaid, fact, the plaintiff was mentally disturbed and therefore, he filed an application on November 18, 1993 seeking his voluntary retirement. The aforesaid request of the plaintiff was accepted on November 23, 1993 by the Senior Superintendent of Police. Subsequently, the plaintiff filed an application on February 16, 1994 withdrawing the aforesaid request made by him on November 18, 1993. The aforesaid request made by the plaintiff was forwarded to the Director General of Police, Punjab. Since in the meantime, the Senior Superintendent of Police had already accepted the request of the plaintiff, therefore, the Director General of Police on July 14, 1994 rejected the request of the plaintiff. The plaintiff claimed that the aforesaid Orders passed by the Senior Superintendent of Police and the Director General of Police were illegal and bad. Consequently, he filed the suit in question.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_5\">4. The defendants contested the claim of the plaintiff. It was maintained by them that while filing the application on November 18, 1993, the plaintiff had requested that he be retired with effect from December 1, 1993. Consequently, the Senior Superintendent of Police accepted the aforesaid request of the plaintiff on November 23, 1993 and the plaintiff was ordered to be retired with effect from December 1, 1993. In these circumstances, the defendants maintained that any subsequent application of the plaintiff on February 16, 1994 withdrawing his original request was wholly without any basis, inasmuch as the original request of the plaintiff had already been accepted in the meantime. Consequently, the Director General of Police had rightly dismissed the request of the petitioner on July 14, 1994.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_6\">5. The suit of the plaintiff was dismissed by the learned Trial Court. The learned trial Court found it as a fact that when the plaintiff had filed an application, Ex.Dl, on February 18, 1993, then, he had specifically mentioned therein that he be allowed to retire with effect from December 1, 1993. Accordingly, the Senior Superintendent of Police had accepted his request and allowed him to retire with effect from December 1, 1993, vide Order Ex.Pl. The said order was to take effect from December 1, 1993 as desired by the plaintiff. It was also held by the learned Trial Court that since the aforesaid request of the plaintiff had already been accepted by the authorities, therefore, the plaintiff could not be heard to claim that he had withdrawn the aforesaid request subsequently on February 16, 1994.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_7\">6. The plaintiff took up the matter in appeal.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_8\">7. The learned first Appellate Court on reconsideration of the controversy, allowed the appeal filed by the plaintiff. It was held that since the Order dated November 23, 1993 had been passed by the Senior Superintendent of Police within a period of three months from the request of the plaintiff and the aforesaid period of three months was, in fact, to be treated as notice period, therefore, when the plaintiff h ad withdrawn the aforesaid request within the aforesaid three months, then he could not be voluntarily retired and the subsequent request made by the plaintiff was liable to be accepted. Consequently, the appeal of the plaintiff was allowed and as a result thereof, the suit filed by the plaintiff was decreed; It was held that the plaintiff was entitled to all service benefits and continuity of service including pay. and allowances from the date he had been retired from service.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_9\">8. At this stage, it may be noticed that the present regular second appeal had been filed in the year 1998 under the provision of Section 41 of the Punjab Courts Act, 1980. A Full Bench of this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/235732/\" id=\"a_1\">Ghana v. Ram Devi</a>. A.I.R. 1978 Punjab &amp; Haryana 137 had taken a view that in view of the aforesaid local law (Punjab Courts Act), the amended provisions of Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as amended in 1976, were not applicable to the second appeals filed in this Court. Accordingly, no substantial question of law was framed nor the aforesaid regular second appeal was admitted on any such substantial question of law. However, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of <a href=\"/doc/327719/\" id=\"a_2\">Kulwant Kaur and Ors. v. Gurdial Singh Mann</a> (dead) by LRs and Ors.  has held that after the amendment of the Code of Civil Procedure in the year 1976, thereby amending Section 100, Section 41 of the Punjab Courts Act had become redundant and repugnant to the <a href=\"/doc/110162683/\" id=\"a_3\">Central Act</a> i.e. Code of Civil Procedure and, therefore, was to be ignored and, therefore, the second appeal shall only lie to this Court under <a href=\"/doc/110162683/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 100</a> of the amended Code of Civil Procedure on a substantial question of law,\n \n\n</p><p id=\"p_10\">10. In view of the law laid down by the Apex Court in Kulwant Kaur's case (supra), during the course of arguments, the following substantial questions of law have arisen for consideration:\n</p>   \n\n<p id=\"p_11\">A. Whether the learned first Appellant Court had misread the document Ex.Dl, the application filed by the plaintiff on November 18, 1993, wherein he had specifically stated that he be retired with effect from December 1 , 1993 and on account of the aforesaid misreading, whether the findings recorded by the learned first Appellate Court are judicially perverse and liable to be set aside?\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_12\">B. As to whether the plaintiff having never served a notice for three months while making the original request on November 18, 1993 and an order having been passed on November 23, 1993 accepting the a foresaid request, still the aforesaid notice period could be presumed to be operative and whether on account of the aforesaid fact, the plaintiff could withdraw his request on November 16, 1994?\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_13\">11. I have heard Shri D.S. Jandiala, learned Additional Advocate General, Punjab appearing for the appellants and Shri P.S. Goraya, learned Counsel appearing for the respondent, and with their assistance have gone through the record.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_14\">12. Shri D.S. Jandiala, learned Additional Advocate General, Punjab has vehemently argued that t he learned first Appellate Court has completely misread the application , Ex.Dl dated November 18, 1993 filed by the plaintiff wherein it had been subsequently mentioned by the plaintiff that he wanted voluntary retirement and pension with effect from December 1, 1993. It is on account of the aforesaid fact that the said application was accepted by the Senior Superintendent of Police on November 23, 1993 and the order of voluntary retirement was to take effect with effect from December 1, 1993. The learned Counsel argued that on account of the aforesaid misreading, the findings recorded by the learned first Appellate Court cannot be legally sustained since they are judicially perverse. It has been argued by the learned Counsel that admittedly the application dated November 16, 1994 withdrawing the earlier request was filed by the plaintiff much after the order had been passed by the Senior Superintendent of Police on November 23, 1993 and therefore, the said request could not be entertained and the same was validly and rightly rejected on July 14, 1994 by the Director General of Police. It has further been contended that since the plaintiff had not served any notice for three months, therefore, the order was passed on November 23, 1993 by the Senior Superintendent of Police and the plaintiff could not be heard to claim that he had withdrawn the original request within the notice period.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_15\">13. As against this, Shri P.S. Goraya, learned Counsel for the respondent has argued that the notice period was mandatory under the Rules. A person seeking voluntary retirement was required to serve a three months' notice and therefore within the aforesaid period of three months, the person making request could always change his mind and withdraw the request. According to Shri P.S. Goraya, once the plaintiff had filed an application on November 16, 1994 withdrawing his request within the notice period, then the order dated November 23, 1993 was liable to be withdrawn and in any case, his subsequent request could not be rejected by the .Director General of Police on July 4, 1994. It has also been argued that in any case, a perusal of Ex.Dl shows that the foot note to the application has been added later on wherein it had been mentioned that the pension/voluntary retirement was to take effect from December 1, 1993. Shri Goraya has argued that the aforesaid foot note was not shown to be in the hand writing of the plaintiff and that the defendants had not led any evidence to show that the aforesaid foot note was written by the plaintiff in the original application. In support of his contention, Shri P.S. Goraya has relied upon two judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in <a href=\"/doc/1962388/\" id=\"a_5\">Balram Gupta v. Union of India</a> and <a href=\"/doc/882187/\" id=\"a_6\">Anr.  and J.N. Srivastava v. Union of India and Anr</a>. .\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_16\">14. I have thoughtfully considered the rival contentions of the learned Counsel for the parties.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_17\">15. The facts which emerge from the record clearly show that the plaintiff had originally filed the application, Ex.Dl, on November 18, 1993. A perusal of the application shows that there is a foot note added and in the aforesaid foot note, it has been mentioned that the aforesaid voluntary retirement/pension be given to the plaintiff with effect from December 1, 1993, although during the course of the arguments, learned Counsel for the plaintiff has argued that the aforesaid foot note was not in his hand writing. I am afraid, neither any such plea was taken by the plaintiff in the plaint nor any evidence to that effect was led by him during the course of trial. It was for the plaintiff to prove his case that the original application dated November 18, 1993 was to take effect after the expiry of three months as per Rules applicable to him. In these circumstances, when the plaintiff made a request that he be voluntarily retired with effect from December 1, 1993 on account of his personal reasons and mental condition, then it was natural for the Senior Superintendent of Police to have accepted the aforesaid request by passing the order dated November 23, 1993. Nothing has been shown by the plaintiff that the aforesaid request was to take effect after the notice period.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_18\">16. No such notice was served by the plaintiff nor any such notice was demanded by the respondents. The requirement of the notice therefore in these circumstances, stood waived when the Senior Superintendent of Police accepted the aforesaid request of the plaintiff on November 23, 1993.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_19\">17. There is no quarrel with regard to proposition of law that if a notice of three months is given by an employee as required under the Rules and the aforesaid request is withdrawn by him within the aforesaid notice period, then even if an order allowing him to retire has been passed in the meantime, still the employee was well within his rights to withdraw the said request within the notice period. The law laid down by Apex Court in Balram Gupta's case and J.N. Srivastava's case is only to that effect. However, as noticed in the present case, there was no notice ever served by the plaintiff. In these circumstances, the aforesaid authorities are not attracted to the present case.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_20\">18. No other point has been urged.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_21\">19. In view of the discussion above, the aforesaid questions of law, A and B, are answered in favour of the defendants/appellants and against the plaintiff/respondent. As a consequence of the answer to two substantial questions of law, the present appeal is allowed. The judgment and decree of the learned first Appellate Court are set aside. The suit filed by the plaintiff shall stand dismissed.\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_22\">20. However, there shall be no order as to costs.\n</p> \n\n",

The Plaintiff relies upon the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1674593/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 311(2)</a> of the Constitution of India.  The Plaintiff case is that he has not been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken against him s required under the Article and that the show cause notice tendered to him was not in conformity with the provisions of the Articles     \n\n (3)  The plaintiff contends that the Defendent did not give to the Plaintiff any opportunity of showing cause against the accuracy of the facts founds by the District Superintendent of Police in a departmental inquiry against the plaintiff.  The second ground on which he plaintiff relies is that in January, 1952 when the show cause notice was tendered to the laintiff, in fact the plaintiff had already suffered the punishment inflicted upon him by the District Superintendent of Police and it was therfore not competent  for the Defendant  to revise the punishment already inflicted after lapse of two years.  The Plaintiff contends that the order of dismissal amounted to double punishment right of the Plaintiff under <a href=\"/doc/17858/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 20(2)</a> of the Constitution of India.  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_3\"> (4)  There are several other gounds mentioned in para 14 of the Plaint for challenging the validity of the order of dismissal.  These  other grounds are however not pressed before me and it is unncessary therefore to summarise them here.  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_4\"> (5)  The facts leading to this suit are shortly as follows:  The Plaintiff joined the police force in the State of Baroda with the State of Bombay, the Plaintiff was absorbed in the police force of the State of Bombay  and on 1-8-1949 was confirmed as  Sub-Inspector of Police and was at material time attached to Karjan police station in Baroda District.  On 31-1-1950 the Plaintiff was found in the garden house of one Haribai Ramdas at village Atali..  At that house, what is prescribed as vet party (drinking party)  was then in progress.  On 2-2-1950, the District Superintendent of Police, Baroda district placed the plaintiff under suspension from 1-2-1950 on the ground that the plaintiff was involved in an offence under the prohibtion act and th3e matter was still under investigation and that the continuance of the plaintiff in office was likely to result in suppression of evidence.  Thereafter, the departmental enquiries proceeding were proceeded in connction with the said incident.  Statements of several persons were taken and ultimately on 21-3-1950, the District Superintendent of Police, Baroda, framed a charge against the plaintiff.  A copy of the charge framed was served on the plaintiff.  The charge framed as follows:-  \n</p>\n<p id=\"p_5\">  \"Serious misconduct in that you ..  ...   ..  ..  attended a drinking party in the garden house of Mr.Haribhai Ramdas at village Atali on 31-1-1950 in flagrant violation of the policy laid down by Government for rigid observance by all public servants vide Government Circular, Political and Serviced Department No.1581/34 dated 13-7-1948. Copies of the following documents are sent herewith in suport of the charge.\"  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_6\"> (6) The documents referred to are copies of a panchanama inquiry report, statements made by several persons, a letter addressed to the Collector by the Mamlatdar Baroda and the aforesaid circular dated  13-7-1948.  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_7\"> (7) It is admitted that the plaintiff received this charge sheet and the documents referred to in the charge-sheet. All these documents were also forwarded to the Dy.Superintendent of Police, Dhaboi for completing the departmental inquiry proceedings and submitting a report to the District Superintendent of Police for final orders.  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_8\"> (8) The Sub-Divisional Police Officer one Shri N.C.Mistri thereafter appears to have proceeded with the departmental inquiry.  It is relevant to point out that as regards the procedure in departmental inquiry, Rules have been framed. These Rules appear in Bombay Police Manual. It is admitted by the parties that the Rules provide for an elaborate procedure for departmental inquiry and inter alia provide for (1) giving  a defaulter all opportunities to be present at the hearing and to hear the evidence led in proof of the charge and cross examine the witness produced for the purpose, (2) for submitting the case for defence and for producing the evidence in defence and for giving complete hearing to the defaulter.  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_9\"> (9) It appears that the Sub-divisional Police Officer Shri.N.C.Mistri proceeded with the departmental enquiry in accordance with the aforesaid rules and provisions and in pursuance of those Rules made his report dated 25-4-1950.  In his report he summarised the evidence led before him and also gave his opinion as he was entitled to do. In his opinion the explanations given by the Plaintiff are acceptable and according to him the charge against the Plaintiff was not proved. The Sub-Divisional Police Officer appears to have forwarded his report in accordance with the Rules to the District Superintendent of Police who was a competent Officer to deal with the matter. By his deceision and order dated 6-5-1950, the District Superintendent of Police  one Shri.B.D.Shah after giving reasons therefor held that the charge against the Plaintiff was proved on evidence on reord beyond a shadow of any reasonable doubt. He therefore passed orders reducing the plaintiff from grade Rs.135/- to Rs.130/- for a period of one year from 01-05-1950. This decision and order served on the Plaintiff and he was also informed that he had a right to appeal against the order within two months from the date of receipt of order. The Plaintiff was given opportunity to appear before and was heard by Shri.B.C.Shah.  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_10\"> (10) The Plaintiff went in appeal against the aforesaid order on 25-7-1950.  The Dy.Inspector General of Police, Northern Range, dismissed the Plaintiff`s appeal on 13-9-1950.   \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_11\"> (11) The Plaintiff thereafter accepted the order of punishment dated 06-05-1950 passed by District Superintendent of Police as binding and sufferred the punishment awarded to him. The punishment which was for one year was completed on 01-05-1951.  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_12\"> (12) By a show cause notice dated 11-01-1952 the defendant (the State of Bombay) referred to the Departmental Proceedings held against the Plaintiff by the District Superintendent of Police, Baroda and the  punishment inflicted upon the Plaintiff on 6-5-1950 as also to the appeal filed by the Plaintiff and the confirmation of the punishment in the appeal and further stated as follows :   \n</p>\n<p id=\"p_13\">  ' And whereas the Government of Bombay consider that the punishment inflicted upon you is inadequate you are hereby required to show cause within one month from the date of receipt of this notice why you should not be dismissed from the Police Force; if you fail to show cause within the aforesaid period, Government will inflict such punishment or pass such order as it deems fit.\"  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_14\"> This is the show cause notice on which  the main contentions of the plaintiff are based. It is at this stage necssary to note that in reply to the show cause notice, the plaintiff addressed a letter dated 19-2-1952 to the defendant through the Secretary, Home Department. By his letter the plaintiff dealt in detail with the charge levelled against him and the departmental proceedings which had taken place.  The plaintiff referred to his long past services and also that he had been the recipent of diverse awards from the Government of Baroda and of Bombay.  The plantiff prayed that the Government should take a lenient and human view of the whole situation and use its authority with mercy.  By its resolution datd 5-4-1952, the defendant after considering the representations made by the plaintiff by his letter dated 19-2-1952 passed orders dismissing the plaintiff from the police force.  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_15\"> (13) In May 1952 the plaintiff appears to have made a representation to the Government of Bombay in connection with his dismissal.  As the plaintiff did not succeed in his representation the plain tiff ultimately filed this suit on 16-7-1953.  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_16\"> (14) The plaintiff's counsel mainly relied on the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1674593/\" id=\"a_3\">Art. 311(2)</a>of the Constitution of India in support of the plaintiff's contention that the order of dismissal was not valid.  Provision in Art 311(2) runs as under:  \n</p>\n  \n\n<p id=\"p_17\">  \"311(2) No such person as aforesaid shall be dismissed or removed or reduced in rank until he has been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him.   \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_18\"> Provided..........................................\"   \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_19\"> (15) The provision in <a href=\"/doc/1674593/\" id=\"a_4\">Art. 311(2)</a> is a repetition of a similar provision in S. 240(3) of the Government of  India Act, 1935.  Both of these provision s have been construed in several dicisions of this court as well as the Supreme Court of Inida.  The provisions of S. 240(3) were the subject matter of decision of the Privy Council in what is popularly mentiuoned as Lal's case.  High Commr.  for <a href=\"/doc/134248/\" id=\"a_5\">India and Pakjstan v. I. M. Lall</a> . Mr. mody places reliance on these decisions and submits that  \n\n  \"It was obligatory on the State to mention and include the grounds why they wanted to impose the punishment of dismissal in the notice dated 11-01-1952.\"  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_20\"> Mr. Mody elaborated his contention by stating that the notice should have specified the charge against the plaintiff and should have referred to the evidence in support of the charge and should have given all the gorunds with particulars as to why the Government (defendant) had tentatively  decided upon inflicting the punishment of  dismissal on the plantiff.  Mr. Mody contended that as all the aforesaiud matters had not been in detail specified in the notice dated 11-1-1952, the noitice wasw not real but illusory.  The notice did not give any reasonable or other opportunity to the plaintiff to make any contentions regardig the charge levelled against him.  Nor did it give any information about the evidence available in support of such a  charge/  Mr. Mody contended that the word \"inadequate\" in the notice was insufficient to convey to the plantiff any information regarding the gournds of enhancement of punishment.   \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_21\"> (16) In connection with his aforesaid contentions, Mr. Mody relied upon the judgment of Chagla C. J. in the case of <a href=\"/doc/452710/\" id=\"a_6\">State V. Gajanan Mahadev</a>,  .  Mr. Mody substantially relied upon the passage at page 178 of Bom. LR: (at p. 354 of AIR) where it is stated as follows:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_22\"> \"It is well settled law that it is not sufficient under this sub-section for the Government merely to inform the servant that it proposes to pass a particular punishment anmd to ask him to show causeagainst that punishment.  The opportunity which the State has to furnish has to be a reasonable opportunity, and the Courts have held that a resonable opportunity is only afforded to the servant when he can show cause not only  against the punisment but also against the ground on which the State proposes to punish him. Therefore, it is not sufficient that the State should call upon the servant to show ccuase against the quantum of punishment intended to be inflicted upon him; the State must also call upon the servant to show cause  against the decision arrived at by a departmental inquiry if that decision constitutes the ground on which the Government proposes to take action against the servant\".  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_23\"> Mr. Mody therefore says that he was entitled to a show cause notice callng upon him to show cause  against the decision arrived at in the deprtmental inquiry and also that the decision in the departmental enquiry was a gound on which the dfendant has relied for the purpose of an enhancemnt of punishment.  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_24\"> (17) In furtherance of his contention Mr. Mody relied also upon the decision of the Privy Council in the case of 50 Bom. L. R. 649: (AIR 1948 PC 121).   He referred to the passage in the decision whereby their Lordships agreed with the view taken bythe majority of the Federal Court in that particular case.  Mr. Mody pointed out , from p. 655 of that report(Bom. LR): (at p. 126 of AIR) that the majority of the Federal Court held   \n\n  \" ................ It seems to us that the sectin requires not only notification of the action proposed but of the grounds on which the authority is proposing that the ation should be taken and that the person concerned must then be given a reasonable time to make his representations against the proposed action and the grounds on which it is proposed to be taken\".  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_25\"> Mr. Mody says that no grounds are mentioned in he notice dated 11-1-1952 and the notice is accordingly not in conformity with the <a href=\"/doc/1674593/\" id=\"a_7\">Art. 311(2)</a> and the dismissal of the plantiff is invalid.   \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_26\"> (18) It appears to me that the contention of Mr. Mody is ill founded.  As is pointed out in each of the aforesaid decisions it is for theCourt to find out from facts of each case as to whether reasonable opportunity has been afforded to the defaulter or the plaintiff within the meaning of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1674593/\" id=\"a_8\">Art. 311(2).</a>  In the case of , it is pointed out by the learned Chief Justice as follows:  \n</p>\n<p id=\"p_27\">  \" It may also be said that it may not be necessary in every case to issue a notice in terms calling upon the servant to show cause not only against the quantum of punishment but also aginst the grounds on which the proposed acton  is based.  Even though, as in this case, the notice may be defective, if in fact the servant has been given the opportunity and has availed himself of the opportunity of showing cause against the grounds, then the mere fact that there is an irregularity about the notice may not lead to the Court holding that the Government Servant did not have the opportunity required under section 240(3). But we think that there can be no doubt that the Court must be satisfied o a revirew of all the facts of a particular case that the statutory obligation cast upon the State has been porperly discharged by the Styate and the statutory obligation is to afford reasonable opportunity to the dismissed servant\".  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_28\"> (19) In Lall\"s case (AIR 1948 PC 121) their Lordships of the Privy Council in approving the judgment of the Federal Court accepted the following.  \n</p>\n<p id=\"p_29\">  \"In our judgment each case will have to turn on its own facts, but the real point of the subsection is in our judgment that the person who is to be dismissed or reduced must know that that punishment is proposed as the punisbhment for certain acts or omission on his part and must be told the grounds on which it is porposed to take such action and must be given a reaponable opportun ity of showing cuase why such punishment should not be imposed.\"  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_30\"> Their Lordships further added,  \n\n  \" If the civil servant has been through an nquiry under R. 55, it would not be reasonable thathe should ask for a repetition of that stage, if duly carried out, but that would not exhaust his staturoty right, and he would still be entitled to represent against the punishment porposed as the result of the findings of the enquiry\".  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_31\"> (20) In the case of <a href=\"/doc/546415/\" id=\"a_9\">Khem Chand v. Union of  India , , Lall</a>'s case  was considered in detail.  The learnd Chief Justice of India at p. 505 (of SCJ): (at p. 306 of AIR) observed that:  \n</p>\n<p id=\"p_32\">   \" It is true that the provision (311(2) does not in terms, refer to different stages at which opportunituy is to be given to the officer concerned. All that it says is that the Government servant must be given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him. He must not only be given an opportunity but such opportunity must be a reasonable one..................  If the opportunity to show cause is to be a reasonable one it is clear that he should be informed about the charge or charges levelled against him and the evidence by which it is sought to be established, for it is only then that he will be able to put forward his defence.......... He should be allowed to show that the evidence against him is not worthy of credence or consideration .  All this appears to us to be implicit in the language used in the clause, but this does not exhaust his rights.  In addition to showing that he has not been gulity of any misconduct so as to ment any pun ishment, it is reasonable that he should also have an opportunity to contend that the charge proved against him do not necessarily require the particular punishment proposed to be meted out to him.......\"  \n</p>\n  \n\n<p id=\"p_33\"> At p. 507 (of SCJ): (at p.307 of AIR) the kearnbed Chief Justice after quoting the passage from Lall's case AIR 1948 PC 11) as quoted above held as follows:    \n</p>\n<p id=\"p_34\">  \"The above passage quite clearly explains that the point on which their Lordships of the Judgment Committee agreed with the majority of the Federal Court is that a further opporutnity I to be given to the Government servant after the charge have been established against him and a particular punishment is proposed ot be meted out to him .., but a close reading of the rest of that passage will indicate that in  heir  Lordship view the  substance of the protection of R. 55 is alos included in S. 240(3) and to that is superadded, by way of  futher protection, the necessity of givbing yet another opporutnity to the govenrment servant at the stage whbere the vcharges are proved against him and a particular punishment is tentatively proposed to be inflicted on hi.  Their Lordships referred to \"statutory opportunity being reasonble afforbed at more than one stage\", that is to say that the opportunity at more stages than one are comprised within the opportunity contemplated by the statute itself.  Of course if the government servant has been through the enquiry under R. 55, it was not be reasonable that he should ask for a repetition of that stage if duly carred out which implies that if no enquiry hasbeen held under R. 55 or any analogous rule applicable to the particular servant then it will bequite reasonable for him to ask for an enquiry.\"  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_35\"> (21)  It appears to me that what is laid down by the decisions in  and  is that in the event of a departmental enquiry having taken place according to the rules of proreasonable for any government servant to ask for a repetition of theat enquiry at the stage of enquiry as to nature and quantum of punishment. At that stage it is necessary by reason of <a href=\"/doc/1674593/\" id=\"a_10\">Art. 311(2)</a> to give him an opprotunity of showing cause against the punishment proposed to be taken in regard to him.  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_36\"> (22) I read the aforesaid decisions to mean that the departmental enquiry duly carried out satisfies the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1674593/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 311(2)</a> so far as opportunity is to be afforded to a government servant in connection with the investigation of charge levelled against him.  After such an enquiry is duly carried out, it is necessarly under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1674593/\" id=\"a_12\">Art.  311(2)</a> to give a second opportunity rto the Govt.  servant (defaulter) to one again reagitate the matter as regards the conclusions already reached in the departmental enquiry.  In my view it is for that very reason that the learned Cheif Justice observed in the case of  that even though the notice may be defective, if the government servant has been given an opportunity and has availed himself of the opporutnity of showing cause against the grounds then the mere fact that there is an irregularity about the notice may not lead to the Court holding that the government servant did not have the opportunity required under S. 240(3).  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_37\">  (23) In this connection I must refer to the recent decision in Appeal No. 69 of 1957 (Bom.). While dealing with the defective show cause notice in that case Chagla C. J. observed as follows:   \n</p>\n<p id=\"p_38\">  \"The last contention urged by Mr. Thakore is that the show cause notice which was issued by the commissioner of Police called upon him merely the show cause aginst the quantum of the sentence and not against the merits of the decision given.  It is perfectly true that it is now well settled law that a civil servant has a right to show cause both against the merits of the decision given.  It is perfectly true that it is now well settled law that a civil servent has a right to show  cause both against the sentence and the merits of the decision when the final show cause notice is issued against him and we would have taken a very serious view of the matter if the appealant had been deprived of the opportunity of showing cause against the findings arrived at both by the inquiry pofficer and the Commissioner of Police.  But unfortunately for Mr. Thakore, the appellant was not deprived of this opportunity because whatever might have een the form of the showe cause notice issued by the Commissioner of Police on 12-12-1955, in fact the appellant showed cause and showed cause very vigorously against the findings both of the inquiry officer and the commisioner of Police.  In face of this, we cannot possibly accept the contention of Mr. Thakore that there as a contravention of <a href=\"/doc/47623/\" id=\"a_13\">Art.  311</a> of the Constitution.\"  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_39\"> It is relevant to point out that the contentions raised by the plaintiff in connection with the show cause notice dated 11-1-1052 appear to be merely technical.  In fact in spite of the alleged defective character of the notice the plaintiff by his letter dated 19-2-1952 raised all contentions as regards the merits of the charge levelled against him as also the qudxgion ov punishment.  The plaintiff not only had reasonable opportunity in the said connectionbut took opportunity and dealt with the matter on the footing that it was open tothe plaintiff to make contentions regarding all details of the charge and the evidece against him as also the quantum of punishment.  The plaintiff has not suffer  by the alleged defect in the notice.  The plaintiff has not made any contentions in the plaint regarding t he departmental enquiry and the same must be deemded to have been duly carried out.   \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_40\"> (24) Having regard to my reading as aforesaid of the decisions of this Court, I have come to the conclusion that the plaintiff had reasonable opportunity of showing cause in respect opf the charge levelledagainst him as also the quantum of punishment that was intended to be inflicted upon the plaintiff.  I am unable to accept the contention of the plaintiff that further grounds regarding the intended punishment of dismissal ought to have been mentiioned or included in the notice given by the defendant.  I do not accept the contentions as made in para 14 (a) of the plaint that the plaintiff has not been given any reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him as required by <a href=\"/doc/1674593/\" id=\"a_14\">Art. 311(2)</a> of the Constitution of India or that the notice is defective and not in conformity with <a href=\"/doc/1674593/\" id=\"a_15\">Art. 311(2) .</a>  The plaintiff had complete opportunity to meet the charge levelled against him.  The plaintiff in fact led evidence in his possession before the proper authority in the said connection and failed to establish that he was not guity.  The plaintiff made all possible contentions regarding the quantum of punishment but failed to succeed.  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_41\"> (25) As regards the cobntents of the show cause notice dated 11-1-1952 I donot think that the same should have been more elaborate.  It is wothy of note that the plaintiff understood the meaning of this notice completely and took opporutnity to deal with the whole of the matter.  The quantum of punishment which was intended to be inflicted is mentioned in the notice.  Prior punishment already inflicted is referred to as inadequate.  The deaprtmental enquiry proceddings in which the plaintiff was punished are also mentioned in the notice.  The plaintiff was thereby  made aware that having regard to its Prohibition Policy the Government took a serious view of defaults of itts employees in connection with Prohibition Policy.  I am unabe to agree with the contention of Mr. Mody that the notice required to mention furthergrounds for intended en hanced punishment of dismissal.  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_42\"> (26) Mr. Mody contended that he was, having regard to delay in evision of punishment, entitled to a new tria and investigation of the charge against him.  He also contended that I should consider the true meaning and effect of the Government Circular regarding Prohibition Policy mentioned in the charge and hold that the finding in the departmental inquiry was incorrect.  I am of the view that the Court is not to reconsider on facts thje decision in the departmental enquiry.  The Court is not entilted to go into the facts to find out as to whether the finding isd correct or not.  I therefore do not think that it is necessary for me to go into these matters.  I cannot accept these contentions of Mr. Mody.  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_43\"> (27) The second contention of the plaintiff is that he having suffered the punishment the State was not entitled to revise or enhance the punishment inflicted upon him.  He contends that this was a case of \"double punishment\".  It is not denied that the State had a right to reconsider the whole of the charge levelled against the plaintiff, and to inflict punishment in revision as it deemed necessary.  The plaintiff has not raised any contention that the State had nob jurisdiction to deal with the matter.  Mr. Mody did not make any argument in support of such contention.  The plaintiff has based all his argument in support of this contention on <a href=\"/doc/17858/\" id=\"a_16\">Art. 20(2)</a> of the Constitution of India.  That Article runs as follows:  \n</p>\n<p id=\"p_44\">  \"No person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once\".   \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_45\"> This Artlcle has been construed on several occations.  In the case of S. A . <a href=\"/doc/1640660/\" id=\"a_17\">Venkataraman v. Union of India</a>, , following <a href=\"/doc/1815080/\" id=\"a_18\">Magbool Hussain v. State of Bombay</a>,  it has been held that:  \n</p>\n<p id=\"p_46\">  \" The language of <a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_19\">Art. 20</a> and the words actually used in <a href=\"/doc/17858/\" id=\"a_20\">Art. 20(2)</a> afford a clear indication that the proceedings in connection with the prosectuion and punishment of a person must be in the nature of a criminal proceeding, before a cxurt of Law or Judicial Tribunal, and not before a Tribunal which entertains a departmental or an administrative inquiry even though set up by a Statute, butn  which is not required by law to try the matter judicially and on legal evidencve.\"  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_47\"> In fact Mr. Mody is unable to carry his arguments further having regard to this judgmnt of the supreme Court which was pointed out by Mr . Dubash .  There was no question of a criminal prosectuion in this case and/or double punishment and I cannot therefore accept the contention raisedd on behalf of the plaintiff.    \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_48\"> (28) In  this connection Mr. Dubash also relied upon the judgment of Gajendragadkar J.  in this Court in Spl. C. A. No. 180 of 1954 where it was held as follows:  \n</p>\n<p id=\"p_49\">  \" It is then contended that this amounts to a double punishment.  In our opinion this argument is wholly fallacious.  There are not two punishments with which the petitioner is conerced.  The petitioner received a minor punishment at the hadns of the District superintendent of Poli ce and  in the exercise of his revisional jurisdiction the Inspector Gnmeral of Police has enhanced that punishment.  It is impossible to accede to the argument that enhancemernt of punishment made in exercise of revisional jurisdiction amounts to a second punishment and that in such a case the party is exposed to the risk of double punishment.  Therefore we must reject the argument that in the present case the petitioner has been subject to the risk of double punishment.\"  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_50\"> There is no substance in the contention of the plaintiff that he has suffered double punishment.  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_51\"> (29) Issues Nos. 4 to 9 were not pressed seriously on behalf of the plaintiff.  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_52\"> (30) My answers to the issues accordingly are:  \n</p>\n   \n\n<p id=\"p_53\"> 1. Negative.  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_54\"> 2. Negative.  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_55\"> 3. Negative.  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_56\"> 4. Negative.  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_57\"> 5. Negative.  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_58\"> 6. Negative.  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_59\"> 7. Negative.  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_60\"> 8. Negative.  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_61\">   9. Negative.  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_62\"> 10. Negative.  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_63\"> 11.Negative.   \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_64\"> (31) After I had delivered iun cout this judgment, in another matter I have been referred to the deicision in <a href=\"/doc/101732/\" id=\"a_21\">Atindra Nath v. G. F. Gilot</a>, .  I have only to record that in that case also it has been held (as I have done in this case) that it is unnecessarly to give a second hearing to a defaulter in case where departmental enquiries have been duly completed.  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_65\"> (32) In the result the suit is dismissed with costs.  \n</p>\n \n\n<p id=\"p_66\"> (33) Suit dismissed.  \n</p> \n\n",

Natarajan, J.   \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_2\"> 1. The accused in S.C. No. 119 of 1986 on the file of the II Additional Sessions Judge, Tirunelveli, has preferred this appeal challenging the legality and correctness of the conviction under S. 302 read with<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_1\"> S. 34</a> I.P.C. and sentence of life imprisonment and also under<a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_2\"> S. 324</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_3\">I.P.C</a>. and sentence of rigorous imprisonment for one year both the sentences to run concurrently.  \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_3\"> 2. The appellant was tried for the above two charges on the allegation that on 27-4-1985 at or about 9.15 a.m. at Meenakshipuram, he along with three others caused the death of the deceased Natarajan alias Subbiah-A1 stabbing him on the chest as well as the hip with aruval while A2 attacking him with tharangu on the right arm and during the course of the same transaction the appellant, who is A1, cut P.W. 1 Gurusami with aruval on his left hand above the wrist and caused a simple injury. To substantiate the above two charges the prosecution examined P.Ws. 1 to 7, filed Exs. P1 to P17 and marked M.Os. 1 to 8.  \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_4\"> 3. The case of the prosecution as disclosed from the oral and documentary evidence can be succinctly stated as follows :  \n</p>  \n\n<p id=\"p_5\"> A1 and A2 are brothers and sons of A3. A4 is the brother of A3. The deceased is one Natarajan alias Subbiah. P.W. 5 and the deceased are stepbrothers born through the same father. P.W. 5 married P.W. 1's eldest sister. P.W. 6 is the wife of P.W. 1. They are all residents of Meenakshipuram village. In the year 1981 there was a competition with regard to Kabadi game at Meenakshipuram in which A2 was successful and he defeated the deceased. It is further stated that A1 and A2, on account of a quarrel, beat the deceased Natarajan. This was witnessed by P.Ws. 1 and 5. A few days later, the deceased stabbed A2 with a knife. In respect of the same a complaint was given to Eppothum Vendran Police station and a case was registered in Crime No. 2 of 1981 under<a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_4\"> S. 324</a> I.P.C., and the deceased was prosecuted and he was convicted. It is further stated that on appeal he was acquitted. After the said case, the deceased left the village and was staying at Virudunagar and was employed as a taxi driver and he used to come twice or thrice in a month to the village since his family was at Meenakshipuram. It is the further case of the prosecution that the deceased came to the village on the day of occurrence 27-4-1985, and he along with P.Ws. 1 to 5 was heaping hayrick and they used a plank for the said purpose. At that time P.W. 4. came there. A little later, A1 came there armed with a kozhival aruval and called P.W. 6 to accompany him to the house of his master Kumar in order to receive the wages. At that time, the deceased found fault with A1 for having brought the aruval there and questioned him. A1 was murmuring and left the place. After completing the work, P.Ws. 1, 4 and 6 and others left the place for taking their meals. P.W. 1 and the deceased, after taking coffee in the house of Aruna chalam, who is none other than the father-in-law of the deceased and after staying there for some time, were proceeding to answer calls of nature. While they were proceeding from south to north A1 to A4 came in opposite direction and at that time A1 was armed with aruval and A2 with kuthu tharangu. A2 instigated the other accused to cut and kill the deceased and so A2 shouted by saying that the deceased had come and he should be cut and killed and so saying he stabbed the deceased on his right arm with kuthu tharangu. A1 cut him with aruval on the chest forcefully. At that time P.W. 1 beat A1 with a plank which he was having on the back and broke it into pieces which are marked as M.Os. 1 and 2. Immediately A1 cut P.W. 1 above the left wrist once. A3 threw a stone on the chest of P.W. 1. In the meantime, after receipt of the injury the deceased went to a distance of 4 Bagams (8 yards) and caught hold of the wall and standing. A1 ran towards him and also cut him across the hip twice with aruval. On receipt of the injury the deceased fell down. Thereupon the accused ran away with the respective weapons. P.Ws. 1 and 3 went near the deceased and found him dead. It was at the time 9.15 a.m. A little later, P.W. 4 came there. P.Ws. 1 to 3 requested him to inform P.W. 5 about the occurrence and give a report. Accordingly P.W. 5 took a cycle and met P.W. 5 who was working in the field. P.W. 5 went to Pasuvanthanai police station with the same cycle directly and reached there at about 10.45 a.m. and reported that his younger brother Natarajan alias Subbian was murdered when A1 cut him with aruval and A2 stabbed him with kuthu tharangu and he got the information through P.W. 4. P.W. 14 entered the same in the General Diary in the station. Thereupon, he, along with the constables, went to the Meenakshipuram police station and thereupon to the scene place at about 11 a.m. He recorded a statement, Ex. P1, from P.W. 1 attested by P.W. 5. Thereupon he sent P.W. 1, with a memo to the Government Hospital, Tuticorin and returned to the police station at 12.45 p.m. and on the basis of Ex. P1 complainant registered a case in Crime No. 14 of 1985 under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_5\">sections 302</a> and <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_6\">324</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_7\">I.P.C</a>. and prepared the first information report Ex. P14 and the copies thereon. He sent Exs. P1 and P14 express report though P.W. 2 to the Judicial II Class Magistrate, Kovilpatti and a copy of the same through P.W. 13 to the Inspector of Police of Ottapidaram, who was in charge of that circle. P.W. 16, who was Inspector of Police (Crimes.) Pudukottai and who was in charge of Ottapidaram circle got information through V.H.S. about the case about 12.40 p.m. from P.W. 14. Thereupon he left Ottapidaram and was proceeding along Pasuvandhanai where he got the copy of Ex. P14 and P.W. 13 at about 1.15 p.m. and he took up investigation. He reached the scene place at 1.30 p.m. inspected the same in the presence of P.W. 8, prepared an observation mahazar, Ex. P2 at about 2 p.m. and drew a rough sketch, Ex. P16 and at about 2.45 p.m. he sent constables to search for the accused. Between 3 and 6 p.m. he held inquest over the dead body of Natarajan alias Subbiah and during the inquest he held inquest over the dead body of Natarajan alias Subbiaih and during the inquest he examined P.Ws. 2 to 5. Ex. P17 is the inquest report he examined prepared by him. After completing the inquest he entrusted the dead body with P.W. 13 constable along with a requisition Ex. P6 to the Medical Officer to conduct autopsy. At 6.45 p.m. he seized the bloodstained earth, M.O. 5 from the place where the dead body was found lying, under Ex. P3 attested by P.W. 8. At about 7 p.m. in front of the Agricultural Seva Sangam he seized M.O. 6 blood-stained earth and M.O. 7 sample earth under cover of a mahazar Ex. P4. He also seized M.O. 1 under cover a mahazar Ex. P5 from the pial of A3's house in the presence of P.W. 8. He examined P.W. 7 to 9 p.m. At that time he produced another broken piece of the plank and he seized the same. P.W. 10 is the Medical Officer attached to the Government Hospital, Tuticorin. He examined P.W. 1 at about 2.30 p.m. on 27-4-1985 for certain injured said to have been caused on 27-4-1985 at 9.15 a.m. and it could be due to cut with an aruval. She noticed the following injury on P.W. 1 :  \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_6\"> \"Incised wound 4\" x 3\" x 2\" on the posterior aspect of left arm in the middle, underlying muscles hanging. Bone is exposed\"   \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_7\"> According to her, the above injury is simple in nature and could have been caused due to cut with aruval. She further stated that P.W. 1 was admitted as an in-patient and he was an in-patient till 16-5-1985. Ex. P8 is the wound certificate issued by her. Ex. P9 is the extract of the entries made in the accident register.  \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_8\"> 4. P.W. 9 is the Assistant Surgeon attached to the Government Hospital, Ottapidaram. In pursuance of the requisition he received from P.W. 16 he conducted autopsy of the dead body of the deceased Natarajan alias Subbiah at about 9 a.m. on 28-4-1985 and he found the following injuries :  \n</p>  \n\n<p id=\"p_9\"> 1. Incised wound over back of right shoulder of 1\" x 1\" x 1\" deltoid muscle fibres cut. \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_10\"> 2. An oblique incised wound of 8\" x 3\" x 4\" extending from above the medial end of left clavicle across the chest up to right nipple.  \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_11\"> 3. Transverse incised wound extending from right loin to left renal ankle of 9\" x 3\" x 6\".  \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_12\"> 4. Transverse incised wound of 8\" x 4\" x 6\" extending from lower left loin to back of right lumber region.   \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_13\"> Internal examination (1) The medial end of left clavicle, manubrium sterna-medial end of right 3rd and 4th ribs and cartileges are served. Transverse part of arch of Aorta served. Trachea and oesophagus served. Right lung; (2) Incised wound of 1\" x 1\" x 1\" over the annterior border.

Ex. P7 is the post-mortem certificate. P.W. 9 was of the further opinion that injury No. 1 noticed by him could have been caused due to stab with a sharp edged weapon like a kuthu tharangu at about 9.15 a.m. It is possible that the injuries 2, 3 and 4 are possible by cutting with an aruval. He was of the further opinion that the external injuries 2 to 4 with the corresponding internal injuries are necessarily fatal and after receipt of the injuries he should have met with the imminent death.  \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_17\"> 5. P.W. 16 continued further investigation and he examined certain witnesses on 30-4-1985. On 3-5-1985 he gave a requisition to the judicial Magistrate to record<a href=\"/doc/78014276/\" id=\"a_8\"> S. 164</a>, <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_9\">Cr.P.C</a>. statement of the witnesses P.Ws 2 and 3. A1, A3 and A4 surrendered before the Judicial Magistrate, Nanguneri on 30-4-1985 and he got information only on 7-5-1985 and A2 surrendered before the Judicial, II Class Magistrate, No. 1, Tirunelveli on 4-5-1985. P.W. 17 took up further investigation. He verified the investigation already done by P.W. 16 and he gave Ex. P. 10 to the court to send the blood-stained articles for chemical analysis.

After completing the investigation P.W. 17 laid the charge-sheet on 24-7-1985 against all the four accused under<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_10\"> S. 302</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_11\">Sections 34</a> and <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_12\">324</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_13\">I.P.C</a>. to the Judicial II Class Magistrate, Kovilpatti.  \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_18\"> 6. When the accused were examined under<a href=\"/doc/140515/\" id=\"a_14\"> S. 313</a>, <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_15\">Cr.P.C</a>. with regard to the incriminating circumstances appearing against them in the evidence, they totally denied the prosecution case. A1 in addition would state that the case put up against him is false. A2 would state that he was falsely implicated in view of the earlier case instituted against the deceased. A3 and A4 had nothing to say.  \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_19\"> 7. Learned trial Judge, after taking into consideration the oral and documentary evidence and for the reasons assigned in the judgment, came to the conclusion that the prosecution has proved the charge against A1 viz., the appellant herein under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_16\">sections 302</a> and <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_17\">324</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_18\">I.P.C</a>. and convicted him thereunder as stated in the opening paragraph of the judgment while acquitting A2 to A4 holding that the prosecution has not established the case against them beyond all reasonable doubt. Aggrieved by the same A1 has preferred this appeal.  \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_20\"> 8. Mr. T. Arulraj, learned counsel for the appellant took us through the recorded evidence and made various statements. According to learned counsel, the first information report under Ex. P1 is inadmissible in evidence as it is hit under<a href=\"/doc/48127346/\" id=\"a_19\"> S. 161</a>, <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_20\">Cr.P.C</a>. and further even if it admissible it is highly belated and hence no conviction can be imposed on the basis of the said case put forth in the first information report. He would further submit that the earlier report give in the case has been suppressed and that this case has been foisted against the appellant on account of the prolonged enmity. Learned counsel also vehemently argued that the witnesses who were examined in this case are all related and interested and that in view of the various answers elicited in cross-examination no reliance could be placed on their evidence. He would submit that the medical certificates issued in this case do not also support the case of the prosecution and particularly the ocular testimony of P.Ws 1 to 3. Learned counsel urged that there is absolutely no motive for the appellant to commit the occurrence of murder as even according to the prosecution, there was enmity between the deceased and A1 in respect of Kabadi game and that was in the year 1981. Learned counsel also submitted that the occurrence took place in a broad day light where there are number of shops and houses and the non-examination of independent witnesses also throws considerable doubt about the version of the prosecution and it is fatal. He would also submit that the learned trial Judge having disbelieved the major portion of the prosecution case, and acquitted A2 to A4, ought not to have accepted the evidence of P.Ws 1 to 3 and convicted the appellant. Learned counsel further submitted that the recovery of M.Os. 1 and 2 cannot be incriminating pieces of evidence to connect the appellant with the crime and the Court below erred in relying on the same for convicting the appellant.  \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_21\"> 9. Per contra, learned Additional Public Prosecutor would submit that in the instant case the delay in lodging the first information report has been explained by the prosecution through the evidence of P.Ws 14 and 12. According to him, it is the evidence of P.W. 14 that he entered the statement given by P.W. 5 in the General Diary as P.W. 5 is not and eye-witness of the occurrence and further P.W. 12, who took the first information report, was examined in order to explain the delay and it is for this court to consider from the said evidence whether the delay has been properly explained or not. No doubt, he fairly submitted that the prosecution ought to have produced the General Diary which was relied on by the prosecution very much to explain the delay as well as to get over the contention that the earlier report was suppressed wherein the earlier statement of P.W. 5 was recorded. He would further submit that merely because P.Ws 1 to 3 are interested and related their evidence cannot be rejected and it is for this Court to consider whether the evidence has to be taken into consideration only with due care and caution and if ultimately the Court comes to the conclusion that the evidence is not reliable, then only the accused are entitled to the benefit of doubt, and it is purely an appreciation of the evidence of P.Ws 1 to 3 According to him, the medical evidence so far as the attack on the deceased by A1 is consistent with the ocular testimony and it cannot be said that there is a material discrepancy which goes to be root of the case. He would further submit that the recovery of M.Os. 1 and 2 cannot be a clinching circumstance to connect the appellant with the crime. When once the evidence of P.Ws 1 to 3 is held to be acceptable, then, the same can be taken into consideration as a corroborative piece of evidence. Learned Additional Public Prosecutor also submits that on the mere fact that A2 to A4 were acquitted it cannot be said that A1 also ought to have been acquitted, and it is for the Court to consider as to how far the evidence of the witnesses can be believed so far as this appellant is concerned.  \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_22\"> 10. Now, the points for consideration in this appeal are :  \n</p>  \n\n<p id=\"p_23\"> 1) Whether the prosecution has proved the guilt of this appellant beyond all reasonable doubt by acceptable evidence ?  \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_24\"> 2) Whether the inordinate delay in lodging the first information report has been explained and whether the earlier report has been suppressed as contended by the defence ?\n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_25\"> 11. POINTS 1 AND 2 : The prosecution mainly relied on the evidence of the eye-wintnesses, P.Ws 1 to 3 and the medical evidence adduced through P.Ws 9 and 10 for establishing the guilt of the appellant, who is A1. We have already set out the details of the case and the evidence adduced by the prosecution through P.Ws 1 to 3 and other witnesses. While narrating the prosecution case. Hence we do not propose to reiterate the same once again except such of those portions which are relevant and necessary for consideration of the various submissions made by learned counsel for the appellant as well as learn. Additional Public Prosecutor. Now let us consider the contention raised on behalf of the appellant with regard to the suppression of the earlier first information report and inordinate and unexplained delay in lodging the first information report in this case. According to prosecution, the occurrence took place at 9.15 a.m. P.Ws 1 to 3 are the eye-witnesses. P.W. 1 is admittedly related to the deceased as P.W. 5, the step-brother of the deceased was his brother-in-law and further he (P.W. 1) and the deceased were friends and they used to play Silambu game and both of them were closely moving.  \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_26\"> 12. The report in this case, Ex. P1 as well as the first information report, Ex. P14, were received by the learned Judicial Magistrate only at about 7.30 p.m. and there is a delay of 10 hours and 15 minutes. According to the prosecution, P.W. 4 came to the scene place immediately after the occurrence when P.Ws 1 to 3 informed P.W. 4. who requested him to go and report to P.W. 5, and P.W. 5, in turn, went to Pasuvandhanai police station at about 10.45 p.m. and reported the matter. But, according to P.W. 14, reported to him the fact that his brother Natarajan alias Subbiah was murdered when A1 cut him with an aruval and A2 stabbed him with Kuthu tharangu and that he got the information through P.W. 4 and he recorded the same in the General Diary and thereupon he proceeded to the scene place along with constables and recorded the statement Ex. P1 from P.W. 1, who was there P.Ws 1 to 3 had also stated that they gave the details of the incident to P.W. 4 and requested him to convey it to P.W. 5 P.W. 4 also informed P.W. 5 about the details of the occurrence. P.W. 5 also in his evidence stated that at about 10-15 a.m. P.W. 4 came to him and informed that his brother Natarajan was murdered by A1 to A4 and he in turn made the same report to Pasuvandhanai police station. It is to be noted that though it is stated that the same was entered in the General Diary, the General Diary was not even Produced in this case, exhibited and marked. Further, even P.W. 14 admitted that he did not show the General Diary to the Inspector. P.W. 16, and even in his statement he did not refer to anything about the entry made in the P.W. 16 P.W. 16 had categorically stated that and P.W. 14 ought to have recorded the complaint and registered the case. But, when he was further questioned whether he has taken any action against P.W. 14 for not taking the complaint and registering the case, he categorically admitted that he did not do so. It is the contention of the appellant that earliest first information report was suppressed and Ex. P1 came into existence long after the arrival of the Inspector and it was fabricated after due deliberation and consultation and on account of enmity the appellant was also impleaded as an accused. It is also to be noted that when an informant came and reported about the murder and also the names of the assailants and details of the occurrence, even though he is not an eye-witness, it is the duty of the Station House Officer to record the same and register a case. In the instant case it is stated on behalf of the prosecution that P.W. 5 was unable to give the full details of the incident, that he entered his statement in the General Diary and then proceeded to the scene place. Even P.W. 14 himself has stated that P.W. 5 complained that his brother was murdered when A1 cut him with an aruval and A2 stabbed him with Kuthu tharangu. If that be the case, it is the duty of P.W. 14 to record his statement and register case on the basis of the same and above all, even accepting his explanation, when he has chosen to record the in the General Diary, that is the very first document which came into existence where it is stated that the appellant was implicated, that should have been produced before Court. The failure to produce the said document even before the investigating officer is certainly fatal and there is every force in the contention put forward by the learned counsel for the defence that the appellant was implicated, that should have been produced before, Court. The failure to produce the said document even before the investigating officer is certainly fatal and there is every force in the contention put forward by the learned counsel for the defence that the entries made in the General Diary will go against the present version of the prosecution case and hence the earlier report also was suppressed. Even with regard to the recording of Ex. P1 from P.W. 1, there is no consistent version with regard to the time and also the circumstances under which it was recorded. According to P.W. 14, he wen to the scene place at about 11 a.m., saw P.W. 1 there and recorded a statement from him. There-upon he returned to the police station at about 11.45 a.m. and registered a case in Cr. No. 14 of 1985 whereas the first information report, Ex. P14, would show that the statement is said to have been recorded only from 11.45 a.m. to 12.15 p.m. Thereupon he returned to the police station. The police station is about 3 k.m. from the scene place. In the cross-examination of P.W. 14 it has been elicited that when he went to the scene place the Inspector of Police was already there. He has also fairly admitted in the cross-examination that in the investigation he did not say that since the details of the occurrence were not correctly known he went to the scene place. It is the evidence of P.W. 16 that at 12.40 p.m. he got the message from the police station about the case by V.H.S. from P.W. 14 and he reached the scene place at 1.30 p.m. When a question was put to P.W. 14 also as to whether P.W. 1 was brought from Tuticorin after he went there, he would state that he did not know.  \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_27\"> 13. Learned Counsel for the appellant drew our attention to the evidence of P.W. 1 and also the wound certificate issued to P.W. 1 as well as the Accident Register. P.W. 1 categorically admitted in his evidence that he went to the Pasuvandhanai police station even at 9-30 a.m. and he was there for about two hours.  \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_28\"> Four of five persons were also there at that time. No signature was taken from him at the police station at that time. Another explanation put forward on behalf of the prosecution was that P.W. 1 was injured and hence he could not proceed to the police station and give a report. That has been falsified by the admission of P.W. 1 himself, who had categorically stated that he went to the police station by cycle and there is absolutely no explanation for his not reporting to the police station immediately. He also admitted that the Village Administrative Officer is also living in the village. Further, even though he was as in-patient in the hospital for nearly about twenty days, it cannot be said that he was not in a position to go to the police station immediately after the occurrence to give a report as it is seen from the Accident Register and the wound certificate that he of his own accord not being accompanied by any constable or anybody went to the hospital at recorded in Ex. P8 that the deceased accompanied by self for report as to certain injuries said to have been caused on 27-4-1985 and P.W. 1 was seen by him at 2.30 p.m. Learned counsel also drew our attention to the entries made in Ex. P9 wherein it is stated that he is alleged to have been assaulted with aruval at 9.15 a.m. On 27-4-1985 at Meenakshipuram by four known persons. According to learned counsel, since P.W. 1 has made such a statement it is only in order to support the said version Ex. P1 was later fabricated by implicating four persons and without attributing any overt act and three persons have been now acquitted. Further, in view of the finding of the trial court and in view of the evidence adduced in this case, even the trial court had not accepted the evidence of the prosecution with regard to the attack of P.W. 1 by four known persons. According to him, A3 pelted a stone on him and he sustained an injury. But, their is no injury on his chest due to pelting of stone and no stone was recovered. It is worthwhile to quote the evidence of P.W. 14 did not obtain any complaint from P.W. 1 though he was there. Only after the Inspector arrived at the scene place a statement was obtained from P.W. 1. This probabilises the version of the defence that Ex. P1 came into existence only long after the arrival of the Inspector. Learned counsel also submitted that even according to Ex. P1, P.W. 1 immediately after the occurrence ran away from the scene place towards south and he nowhere stated that subsequently he returned and also he had taken the broken pieces of the plank to his house. According to him, P.W. 1 could not have been the author of Ex. P1 but Ex. P1 could have been prepared much later after the arrival of the Inspector and the Sub-Inspector and after due consideration and deliberation on account of prior enmity between the deceased and the family of the accused. According to the defence, when the occurrence took place the deceased might have met with death much earlier to the alleged, in the morning, and nobody would have witnessed the occurrence and PW 1 would not have sustained injury at the time of the occurrence and in any event, having given an earlier report and suppressed the same they have now come forward with the present version by fabricating Ex. P1. In these circumstances, the delay in sending the first information report assumes much importance.  \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_29\"> 14. Further, on the face of admission of P.W. 1 himself that he was in the police station from 9.30 a.m. for about two hours, the entire version of the prosecution now put forward before this Court that P.W. 1 did not go there and that they sent information to P.W. 5 and the Sub-Inspector came to the scene place and obtained a statement Ex. P. 1 and on the basis of the same a case was registered are all contrary to truth. We have no hesitation in holding that no reliance could be placed with the present version of the prosecution. On the other hand, we find every force in the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that the first information report could not have come into existence at about 11.45 a.m. as stated by the prosecution. That P.W. 1 was brought from the hospital and thereupon Ex. P1 could have been prepared is also probabilised by the admission of P.W. 2 who would state that immediately after the assault on P.W. 1 he was lying unconscious and he was taken in an unconscious state to Tuticorin hospital in a bus.  \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_30\"> 15. Now the prosecution also relied on the evidence of P.W. 12 to explain the delay in the despatch of the report to the Judicial II Class Magistrate, Kovilpatti. It is the evidence of P.W. 12 that at about 1 p.m. he got the first information report and he handed over the same to the Judicial II Class Magistrate at about 7.30 p.m. Thereupon he gave the copies of the same to the higher officials. When he was cross-examined he would state that it would take only 45 minutes to reach Kovilpatti from Pasuvandhanai by bus. He would state that he went by A.K.S.R. Bus on that day from Pasuvandhanai to Kovilpatti. When he was further questioned he fairly admitted that he did not purchase any ticket or there was no 'bus warrant' to support his version that he travelled in the said bus. He would further state that the said bus broke down and it was repaired only at 4.30 p.m. Thereupon he got another but at 6 O'clock. When he was asked whether he has stated all these things in his <a href=\"/doc/523607/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 162</a> Cr.P.C., statement to the Inspector, P.W. 16, he fairly admitted that he did not say so. We have also perused his <a href=\"/doc/523607/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 162</a> Cr.P.C., statement and there is absolutely no explanation whatsoever for the delay and the version now put forward by him for the first time in Court is nothing but an invention and without any basis. Further, it is also in evidence that on the day in question P.W. 14 admittedly had been to Ottapidaram and he was with P.W. 16 in connection with the bandobust for the celebration in the temple at Pasuvendhanai. This probabilises the version of the defence that P.M. 14 could have accompanied the Inspector and only after the arrival of the Inspector. Ex. P1 could have come into existence. From the version answers elicited in the evidence of witnesses and also the materials we find that the earliest versions put forward in this case has been suppressed and further the delay of nearly ten hours in lodging the first information report is inordinate and unexplained and this delay is certainly fatal in the circumstances of the case. In this connection, it is worthwhile to refer to the decisions of the Apex Court of the land. <a href=\"/doc/147273/\" id=\"a_23\">In Thulia Kali v. State of Tamil Nadu</a>,  it is held as follows :  \n</p><p id=\"p_31\">  \"First information report in a criminal case is an extremely vital and valuable piece of evidence for the purpose of corroborating the oral evidence adduced at the trial. The importance of the above report can hardly be overestimated from the standpoint of the accused. The object of insisting upon prompt lodging of the report to the police in respect of commission of an offence is to obtain early information regarding the circumstances in which the crime was committed, the names of the actual culprits and the part played by them as well as the names of eye-witnesses present at the scene of occurrence. Delay in lodging the first information report quite often results in embellishment which is a creature of afterthought. On account of delay the report not only gets bereft of the advantage of spontaneity danger creeps in of the introduction of coloured version exaggerated account or concocted story as a result of deliberation and consultation. It is, therefore, essential that the delay in the lodging of the first information report should be satisfactorily explained\".  \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_32\"> <a href=\"/doc/147977556/\" id=\"a_24\">In Sevi v. State of Tamil Nadu</a>,  it is held as follows :  \n</p><p id=\"p_33\">  \"Though he claimed that relevant entries had been made in the general diary at the Station the Sub-Inspector did not also produce the general diary in Court. The production of the general diary would have certainly dispelled suspicion. In the circumstances we think that there is great force in the submission of the learned counsel for the accused that the original F.I.R. has been suppressed and, in its place some other document has been substituted. If that is so, the entire prosecution case becomes suspect. All the eye-witnesses are partisan witnesses and not withstanding the fact that four of them were injured we are unable to accept their evidence in the peculiar circumstances of the case\".  \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_34\"> In Ramasamy v. State of Tamil Nadu (DB), 1982 LW Crl 63 : (1983 Cri LJ NOC 45 (Mad)) it is observed as follows :  \n</p><p id=\"p_35\">  \"The FIR is a statement which can only be used to corroborate or contradict the version of the maker of it and if is not substantive evidence. If there is a doubt about the F.I.R. being fabricated or brought into existence to deliberation, the entire fabric of the prosecution case collapses. Fourteen accused have been implicated in this case who belong to the opposite group of the prosecution party. The court must, of course, make an attempt to separate grain from the chaff if it is possible. We are satisfied that, on the facts of this case and having regard to the interested evidence of the prosecution witnesses, it would be unsafe to convict the accused\".  \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_36\"> This view is supported by another Division Bench of this Court in Johny and Five others v. State, 1990 LW Crl 175, wherein it is held as follows :  \n</p><p id=\"p_37\">  \"The first information report a document of considerable importance, is produced and proved in criminal trials not as a piece of substantive evidence, but with the avowed object of obtaining the early information of the alleged criminal activity and to have a record of the circumstances before there was time for them to be embellished or forgotten. A quick first information report, which reaches the Court of the Magistrate with promptitute, will be a towering circumstance which will go a long way to assure the veracity of the prosecution story if, there can be no time to create and deliberate a false case against the accused. It may be in some cases the delay in lodging the first information report may be inevitable, but such delay may have to be satisfactorily explained. Courts have held that long and unexplained delay not only in lodging the first information report but also in its receipt in the Court and suspicious circumstances to be taken into consideration while judging the bona fides of the prosecution story, as delay may bring in a coloured version of the whole incident. A delayed first information report, which gives rise to suspicion, will put the Court on guard to look for a possible and acceptable explanation for the delay. A delayed first information report in prosecutions where there are more accused than one will require careful scrutiny and more so when the possibility of false implication looms large\".   \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_38\"> Applying the ratio of the above decisions to the facts of this case, we have also no hesitation in holding that in the instant case Ex. P1 came into existence in a suspicious circumstance and there is every force in the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that by non-production of the alleged entry made in the general diary, the prosecution has Ex. P1 cannot be the first information report and it is not safe to rely upon Ex. P1 and in view of the inordinate and unexplained delay also, the contention put forward on behalf of the appellant that the version of the prosecution throws considerable doubt with regard to the participation of this appellant in this occurrence and that it is not safe to rely on the evidence of the eye-witnesses who are interested in the prosecution.  \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_39\"> 16. As regards the motive aspect is concerned, the prosecution relied on the earlier incident which is said to have taken place in the year 1981. Even according to the prosecution, in respect of a competition in the kabadi game A2 alone took part in the said game and he competed the deceased, and, on account of the same, a dispute arose and consequently A2 was stabbed by the deceased and it was only A2 who gave a complaint to P.W. 15, Sub-Inspector of Police, on 3-1-1981 at Eppothum Vendran police station and a case was registered in Cr. No. 2 of 1981 under section in 324 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_25\">I.P.C</a>., which is evidenced by Ex. P15 and consequently it ended in conviction and the deceased was convicted and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months. Though it is stated that on appeal he was acquitted, no documentary evidence whatsoever was produced before Court to substantiate the same. Even P.W. 15 is unable to say as to what happened after conviction. Whatsoever it may be, even according to the prosecution, after the incident the deceased left the village and he was employed as a taxi driver at Virudunagar and he used to attend the village two or three times in a month as his family was located at Meenakshipuram village. Further three is absolutely no dispute between A2 and the deceased after the said case. There is absolutely no reason whatsoever for this accused/appellant to attack the deceased and would go even to the extent of murdering him. Next the prosecution relies on the incident which is said to have taken place at about 8.15 a.m. when A1 went to the land of the father-in-law of the deceased where the deceased, P.W. 1 and P.W. 4 were attending to heaping up the hay-stalk and P.W. 6 was there and A1 called P.W. 6 to accompany him to the house of his master in order to secure the wages, and it is stated that it was at that time since A1 was having an aruval the deceased found fault with him and quarrelled and questioned him as to how he can bring aruval and A1 left murmuring. As rightly contended by learned counsel for the appellant we find that from these materials it cannot be said that A1 had adequate and sufficient motive to murder the deceased whatever it may be, since the alleged occurrence is said to have taken place in a broad day light and there are direct eye-witnesses to the occurrence, motive does not assume importance if the evidence of the eye-witnesses are otherwise trust-worthy and acceptable.  \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_40\"> 17. Now let us consider the evidence of the eye-witnesses, P.Ws. 1 to 3. P.W. 1 is admittedly related to the deceased as his elder sister Subbulakshmi is given in marriage to P.W. 5. P.W. 5 is the step-brother of the deceased viz., that P.W. 5 was born to another wife of the deceased's father. It is to be noted that though P.W. 1 was a witness to the occurrence and the occurrence is said to have taken place on 27-4-1985 he was examined only for the first time in respect of the occurrence only on 14-6-1985 by P.W. 17. There is no explanation for not examining him on a prior occasion and for the first time his <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 161</a> Cr.P.C. statement was recorded, nearly about 1 1/2 months and the statement was sent only along with the charge-sheet. There is no explanation for not examining him at the earliest point of times as even though he was admitted as an in-patient in the Government Hospital by P.W. 10 on 27-4-1985 and he was discharged on 16-5-1985 itself and he sustained only simple injury and that too on the left arm and it is not the case that he was unconscious and he was unable to give any statement. The fact that his statement itself was recorded nearly after 1 1/2 months itself is sufficient to reject his evidence as no reliance could be placed on such a belated version during investigation and especially in respect of the important eye-witness to the occurrence who is the informant in this case. It is also in evidence that he is closely associated with the deceased, he is very much interested in the deceased, that both of them were always found together and they used to play Silambu. Learned counsel for the appellant drew the attention of this Court to the statement during inquest that at the time of occurrence he was actually collecting the hay-stalk, it is the case of the prosecution that the collecting of hay-stalk was only in the premises of the father-in-law of the deceased while the occurrence is said to have taken place on the road inside the village. P.W. 1 categorically admitted that he had stated to the Inspector when he was examined at the time of occurrence he was arranging the hay-stalk. If that be the case, he would not have been an eye-witness to the occurrence and he would not have sustained injury during the said incident. On the other hand, a suggestion was put to these witnesses that whether the deceased himself and others indulged in a quarrel in the village in the early morning and during the quarrel between them and the Devar community people the deceased would have met death and he also sustained injuries. We have already held that this version during his giving report at 11.45 a.m. is highly doubtful. His evidence with regard to the attack by A-3 on him by pelting a stone has been disbelieved and A3 has been acquitted on this ground. His conduct in the reporting the matter to the village Administrative Officer and as well as in the police station or to report others also throws considerable doubt in respect of his version now before Court. Further, learned counsel also drew our attention to his evidence that he and the deceased took coffee about a few minutes prior to the incident in the house of the father-in-law of the deceased. But, significantly P.W. 9, the Medical Officer attached to the Government Hospital, who conducted the autopsy did not find any liquid contents in the stomach and he had categorically stated that if any coffee or liquid has been taken it would have taken three hours for digestion. But, he found that the stomach was empty. This also was pointed out by learned counsel for the appellant that P.W. 1 would not have accompanied the deceased or the occurrence could not have taken place at the time and in the manner spoken to by this witness and no reliance could be placed. Further, learned counsel also relied on the evidence of P.W. 9 and the post-mortem certificate and submitted that when the stomack itself was empty the question of P.W. 1. and the deceased proceeding to answer calls of nature would not arise and as such his version that when he and the deceased were proceeding to answer calls of nature and at that time the deceased was attacked and when he intervened he was also attacked cannot be accepted. In any event, these aspects throw doubt about his version regarding the occurrence wherein he was an eye-witness. It is also to be noted that according to his evidence that he beat A1 with M.Os. 1 and 2 and A1 sustained bleeding injury on the back. If that be the case, certainly, the investigating officer should have given requisition to examine A1 by the Medical Officer, since A1 himself surrendered before Court within three days of the occurrence. There is absolutely nothing to show that he beat A1 and A1 sustained injuries and that M.Os. 1 and 2 were broken only in that circumstance. In any event, the failure on the part of the investigating officer to probe further and in the absence of any evidence with regard to the sustaining of injuries on the part of the person said to have been injured. This version cannot be accepted. The learned trial Judge is also not right in relying on the presence of blood-stains on M.Os. 1 and 2 as there is absolutely nothing to show that A1 sustained any bleeding injuries. Even otherwise, the mere fact that M.Os. 1 and 2 contained human blood, it is not sufficient to connect the same with the attack either on the deceased or on A1 unless in the absence of any detection of blood group which tallied with that of A1 or that of the deceased. Learned counsel also drew our our attention to the earlier version of this witness, P.W. 10, who is sustained injuries due to the cut with aruval by four known persons while his evidence Before Court is contra to the same. Thus, on a careful consideration of the above aspects, we have no hesitation in holding that the evidence P.W. 1 though injured is not reliable and no conviction can be given on the basis of the said evidence. The version of P.W. 1 now before court that after the occurrence he returned to the scene place and he was there till the police came is falsified by the earlier report wherein he had only stated that he ran towards south after the occurrence and there is absolutely nothing to show about his return. Similarly there is nothing about his taking the broken pieces of M.O. 1 and kept in his house. On the other hand, there is evidence to show that M.Os. 1 and 2 were available at the scene place when the Sub-Inspector came and as such on that score also his evidence is proved to be untrue.  \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_41\"> 18. Next we have to see the evidence of PW. 2. PW. 2 is a chance witness. He is a resident of Seekampatti. It is his evidence that on the day of occurrence he came to his elder brother's house in connection with a feast and while he was in the shop of PW 3 he happened to witness the occurrence. Admittedly there is a deformity in his leg and he cannot walk. He was actually sitting in the shop and witnessed the occurrence. It has been elicited in the cross-examination that it is not possible to witness the occurrence from the shop of PW 3. Only if one comes to the junction of the middle road can witness the occurrence. Since he is a lame man he cannot stand and he was actually sitting in the shop, he could not have witnessed the occurrence. Even he himself admits that he could not stand continuously for five minutes. According to his version in<a href=\"/doc/48127346/\" id=\"a_27\"> S. 161</a>, <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_28\">Cr.P.C</a>. statement nobody cut the deceased on the back, which is contrary to the case of the prosecution. He had categorically stated that the stone pelted by A3 may lying there and he pointed out to PW 14, Sub-Inspector and he took him and this has been falsified by the evidence of PW. 14. He did not see any such stone in the scene place. According to this witness, M.Os. 1 and 2 were blood-stained and they were taken from the scene place by PW 14 which is also contrary to the prosecution case. It is further admitted by him that PW 1 immediately after the occurrence ran towards south and the present version that PW 1 was at the scene place is contrary to his evidence. It was put to this witness that he never came to the village and he was only dependent upon the father-in-law of the deceased and it was only at his instance he was deposing falsely. Even the trial court pointed out while giving evidence he was sitting in a chair, he was aged 55 years and he was getting old age pension from the Government on the ground that he is an orphan. According to PW 3, this witness was sitting in his shop and he was conversing with him at the time of occurrence. PW 2 did not say that he was standing and witnessed the occurrence, but, on the other hand he would say that he was actually sitting in the shop at the time of occurrence. If that be the case, he could not have witnessed the occurrence. The various answers elicited in cross-examination of this witness clearly show that he could not have witnessed the occurrence and his presence also on that day in the village is highly doubtful.  \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_42\">  19. Next comes the evidence of PW 3. PW 3 is aged about 52 years. Admittedly he is related to the deceased as his elder sister's daughter is given in marriage to the deceased. Further, while he was in witness box he was asked to identify the accused one by one. But, he was unable to do so though the witness box is about 25 feet from the place where the accused were standing. Learned counsel for the appellant rightly argued that if the witness was unable to identify the accused who was standing at a distance of 25 feet, this witness could not have witnessed the incident which is said to have taken place at 8 yards i.e., 24 feet away from his shop. We find every force in the contention of the learned counsel in this regard. When he is unable to see the accused who were at a distance of 25 feet, when he gave evidence in court, he could not have witnessed the incident and would not have seen this accused who was at a distance of 24 feet from the place where he was standing at the time of the alleged occurrence. Further, the shop of PW 3 was not shown in the rough sketch, Ex. P16 prepared by the investigating officer and it has been categorically admitted that it is not possible to witness the occurrence from his shop. He categorically admitted that he did not inform this incident to anybody who came immediately after the occurrence, including the father-in-law of the deceased. In view of the various answers elicited from the evidence of this witness, certainly, he could not have witnessed the occurrence. On the other hand, learned counsel for the appellant vehemently argued that according to the prosecution, the occurrence took place in the broad-day light and at the place of occurrence there were number of houses and shops. The investigating officer did not choose to examine any of the independent witnesses, particularly neighbours and there is absolutely no explanation for not examining them as witnesses in this case. Learned counsel for the appellant is perfectly justified in his submission that since those witnesses are not willing to depose falsely to support the version of the prosecution, they were not cited and examined and certainly in the absence of any explanation for not citing and examining their witnesses, an adverse inference can be drawn. It is not the case of the prosecution that though they have witnessed the occurrence they were not willing to depose. It is the duty of the prosecution to examine those witnesses and to cite them as witnesses and if they are not able to examine them in Court they should have given reasons for not examining them. In the instant case admittedly no attempt has been made to examine any of these independent witnesses and cited and examine them before the Court. Hence we are of the opinion that the non-examination of the independent witnesses is also fatal to the case of the prosecution besides the witnesses already examined, the evidence of PWs 1 to 3 is not reliable and acceptable.  \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_43\"> 20. Next we have to see the medical evidence. The medical evidence adduced through PW 9 who conducted the autopsy also did not support the case of the prosecution. PW 9 conducted the autopsy and noticed as many as four external injuries and issued the post-mortem certificate, Ex. P7. He would state that the deceased would have died as a result of the shock and hemorrhage due to injuries sustained by him before 24 hours and the injuries 2 to 4 are necessarily fatal. According to him, injury No. 1 could not have been caused by the Kuthu Tharangu and his evidence was accepted and A2 was acquitted on that ground. As regards injury No. 2, the evidence of PW 9 was that the said injury was fatal. After receipt of the injuries he could not have moved or walked and the death would have been instantaneous. According to the version of the prosecution, after receipt of the injuries he walked to a distance of 30 feet and thereafter he was attacked again by A1, who cut him twice on his back and the hip. This version has been falsified by the medical evidence and according to the medical evidence if injury No. 2 was caused first, injuries Nos. 3 and 4 are only post-mortem injuries. If that be the case, the present version that after receipt of injury No. 2 the deceased went to a distance and thereafter he was inflicted with injuries Nos. 3 and 4 only after receipt of the injuries Nos. 3 and 4 he died, cannot be accepted. The Medical Officer, PW 9 also probabilises the defence version that the deceased would have died about two hours prior to the time alleged by him. If that is accepted, the occurrence could have taken place at the early morning of that day. As already stated, the Medical Officer also ruled out the possibility of the deceased taking coffee prior to the occurrence since he had stated that if he had taken coffee prior to the incident. As regards the injury found on PW 1 also, the doctor opined that the injury found on PW 1 also, the doctor opined that the injury is a simple one and could have been caused about 2 to 3 hours prior to the alleged time for the injured and he himself admitted before the doctor. If already a case was registered and he was sent by the Sub-Inspector, certainly, he could have accompanied by a constable. This answer also clearly shows that till about 2.30 p.m. when he was present no case has been lodged and registered. Next the prosecution relied on the recovery of M.Os. 1 and 2 to connect this accused with the crime. We do not find any justification in the same. M.O. 1 is a plank. According to the prosecution, PW 16, has seized M.O. 1 from the house of A3 on the day of occurrence under Ex. P5. M.O. 2 was produced by PW 7, wife of PW 1 to PW 16 and both M.Os. 1 and 2 contained only human blood. It is to be noted that A3 from whose house M.O. 1 was seized was acquitted, and it is not the case of the prosecution that M.O. 1 was seized from the house of A1. Though he has stated that M.O. 2 was produced by PW 7, wife of PW1, we have got the evidence of the eye-witnesses that M.Os. 1 and 2 were lying at the scene place when the Sub-Inspector came. There is no consistent evidence with regard to the seizure of M.O. 2 on being produced by PW 7. In view of the answers elicited in cross-examination that M.Os. 1 and 2 which were lying in the scene place, the seizure by PW 16 during investigation from the house of A3 and from PW 7 there is considerable doubt and in any event, the fact that M.Os. 1 and 2 contained only human blood and the blood group could not be ascertained, and that they were seized during investigation from A3's house and being produced by PW 7, it cannot be said that the seizure of those M.Os. 1 and 2 which had not been used by A1 can be an incriminating circumstance against the accused to hold that he is liable for the offence of murdering the deceased. Thus, on a careful consideration of the entire materials, we are of the view that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the guilt of this accused in respect of both and he deserves to be acquitted and his conviction is not sustainable.  \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_44\"> 21. In the result, the appeal is allowed, the conviction and sentence are set aside and the appellant is acquitted. Bail bonds, if any, shall stand cancelled.  \n</p> \n\n<p id=\"p_45\"> 22. Appeal allowed.  \n</p>\n \n\n",
